Cryptojacking involves using someone\\x89Ûªs CPUs to secretly mine cryptocurrency without that person\\x89Ûªs permission. And according to a report by the UK\\x89Ûªs National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) entitled The Cyber Threat to UK Business, \\x89ÛÏcryptojacking will likely become a regular source of revenue for website owners.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rThe price for a cyberattack is high, both reputationally and financially. And while corporations are ramping up their cybersecurity defenses, the threat of a security breach has not abated. If anything it\\x89Ûªs intensified with the rise of cloud technology where sensitive data is stored and also cryptocurrency mining, where cybercriminals in 2017 rode the wave of the rise in the cryptocurrency prices.\\r\\rThe report reveals that the perpetrators of cryptojacking are two-pronged, stemming both from hackers and website owners who \\x89ÛÏused the processing power of visitors\\x89Ûª CPUs to mine cryptocurrency for their own financial gain.\\x89Û\\x9d For example, earlier this year a US business decided it was okay to user its visitors\\x89Ûª CPUs to mine Monero if that visitor used an ad-blocker. The website, however, informed its visitors of the plan in order to \\x89ÛÏrecoup lost ad revenue.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rCryptojacking remains a security threat as long as the interest surrounding cryptocurrencies remains \\x89ÛÏstrong,\\x89Û\\x9d the report suggests.\\r\\rCryptojacking via malware is not new to the scene and has been used by cybercriminals to secretly mine bitcoin or other digital coins for years. But for the 2018-2019 period, a \\x89ÛÏnewer technique of mining cryptocurrency\\x89Û\\x9d has emerged that \\x89ÛÏexploits visitors to a website,\\x89Û\\x9d and this has become the key threat, the report indicates.\\r\\rFor instance, in February 2018 alone, thousands of websites globally and hundreds in the UK \\x89ÛÏsecretly mined cryptocurrency through a compromised screen-reading plugin for blind and partially sighted people.\\x89Û\\x9d Meanwhile, in December 2017, when the bitcoin price reached its height and miners were generating profits hand over fist, more than half of businesses around the world \\x89ÛÏwere impacted by cryptominers,\\x89Û\\x9d the report reveals.\\r\\rThe bad news is that the problem isn\\x89Ûªt going away any time soon \\x89ÛÒ\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏPopular websites are likely to continue to be targets for compromise, serving cryptomining malware to visitors, and software is available that, when run in a webpage, uses the visiting computer\\x89Ûªs spare computer processing power to mine the digital currency Monero.\\x89Û\\x9d \\x89ÛÓ NCA report\\r\\rBut if you notice a slowdown in your computer\\x89Ûªs performance or a sudden jump in usage, these are signals that your CPUs or GPUs may have been invaded by cryptojackers. The report suggests using an ad-blocker or antivirus software that\\x89Ûªs designed to detect the nefarious cryptojacking activity.\\r\\rHere\\x89Ûªs an illustration of what victims of the WannaCry ransomware faced on their computers last year, with the hackers demanding a payment in \\x89ÛÏbitcoin only\\x89Û\\x9d to recover the lost files.\\r\\rA South Korean web-hosting company paid the BTC ransom, which was worth USD 1 million. Meanwhile, DDoS attacks grew more pervasive in 2017, with the number of instances having risen more than 90% in September 2017 versus January of last year. As CCN previously reported, however, hackers are turned off by the volatility in the bitcoin because of the price instability and therefore shifted to fiat money-denominated ransoms instead.\\r\\rFeatured image from Shutterstock.\\r\\r', 'Police in Russia have developed a case against two organizers of a cryptocurrency mining farm in Orenburg, according to Irina Volk of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation, RIA56, a Russian news source, reported.\\r\\rMore than 6,000 pieces of computer equipment were discovered at the former plant of the RTI which police believe was a mining farm. Police had installed agents at the site. The bitcoin farm used 8 million kilowatts per hour without taking into account power consumption.\\r\\rPolice found equipment connected to the power grid, as well as power supply cables leading to a nearby substation.\\r\\rThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Orenburg region identified suspects involved in the crime, Volk said. They included two company executives working in the factory. The criminal case is based on property damage.\\r\\rA mining farm was reported in early March, but police did not comment on it at the time. Engineers suspected large-scale theft of electricity and alerted law enforcement, who discovered powerful computer equipment they suspected was used for cryptocurrency mining.\\r\\rPolice have not assessed the scale and profitability of the farm or the amount of damage caused.\\r\\rAlso read: Russian engineers caught using state supercomputer to mine bitcoins\\r\\rIn March, sources claimed a mining workshop in Orenburg was the largest in the Volga Federal District.

Not only is bitcoin out of the doldrums, but it\\x89Ûªs onward and upward from here.\\r\\rThis according to Pantera Capital Management, a cryptocurrency hedge fund with $800 million-plus in assets under management, in a letter to investors cited on Bloomberg.\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏFor those who are new to Pantera who might think a fund manager like Pantera would always be saying \\x89Û÷Today\\x89Ûªs a great day to get long. I rarely have such strong conviction on timing. A wall of institutional money will drive the markets much higher,\\x89Û\\x9d according to Pantera\\x89Ûªs Dan Morehead and Joey Krug in the note.\\r\\rJust look at their track record. Pantera, which first gained exposure to bitcoin in 2014, has only made a trio of buy calls and a single recommendation in the past seven years, as per their note. So they\\x89Ûªre not reckless about making these calls in the least. The latest call of a bottom comes on the heels of bitcoin breaching its pivotal 200-day moving average, which reflects the long-term trend.\\r\\rA rising tide lifts all boats, and the other cryptocurrencies are trading in the green as well. The news couldn\\x89Ûªt come too soon after the bitcoin price had been slipping and sliding since a month ago. If Pantera\\x89Ûªs right, the storm clouds have cleared and the sun is about to shine on bitcoin investors.\\r\\rEvery bitcoin investor has been wondering what the bottom is during this bear market of 2018, and Pantera said the floor was $6,500. Now that it\\x89Ûªs crossed the psychologically important 200-day moving average, and while every day may not be an up day, expect trading above that level for most of the coming year. Not only that, but it\\x89Ûªs only a matter of time before bitcoin beats last year\\x89Ûªs record price of nearly $20,000.\\r\\rNobody is happier to hear that the worst is over for bitcoin than Pantera, which through year-end 2017 had generated returns of some 25,000% since the fund\\x89Ûªs inception. But Pantera like many funds invested in cryptocurrencies has struggled with the bear market, especially in March.\\r\\rThe value of its Digital Asset Fund was nearly halved last month when it lost 45.7% of its value. It was the volatility in the bitcoin price that rocked the fund, \\x89ÛÏwhich was the worst in [their] model\\x89Ûªs 27-month history,\\x89Û\\x9d as per Pantera\\x89Ûªs Krug cited in last month\\x89Ûªs investor letter.\\r\\rKrug is no doubt breathing a sigh of relief as all of the crypto community can do now that this technically important level has been achieved.\\r\\rFeatured image from Shutterstock.\\r\\r', 'Fintech startup Ripple is pushing back against claims that its cryptocurrency, XRP, is a security under US regulations.\\r\\rThe XRP token \\x89ÛÓ which functions as the native currency of the San Francisco-based company\\x89Ûªs public Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL) and the foundation for several of the firm\\x89Ûªs blockchain products \\x89ÛÓ is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of more than $22 billion.\\r\\rSome allege that because Ripple distributes XRP by selling the coins \\x89ÛÓ and most buyers purchase them as investments \\x89ÛÓ it is subject to the same securities regulations that govern stocks, bonds, and even many initial coin offering (ICO) tokens.\\r\\rIf true, this could have serious legal ramifications, both for Ripple and the cryptocurrency exchanges that list it for trading.\\r\\rRipple, though, argues that those claims are unfounded.\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏWe absolutely are not a security. We don\\x89Ûªt meet the standards for what a security is based on the history of court law,\\x89Û\\x9d Ripple\\x89Ûªs chief market strategist, Cory Johnson, said during an interview with CNBC.\\r\\rThe discussion over whether XRP is a security resurfaces at semi-regular intervals, but the current debate stems from comments made by Coinbase President and COO Asiff Hirji in a recent appearance what may as well be renamed the \\x89ÛÏCryptocurrency News and Bitcoin Channel.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rToward the end of the interview, Hirji said that the exchange and brokerage giant is already listing every cryptocurrency for which it believes there is regulatory certainty. At present, the company lists four cryptocurrencies \\x89ÛÓ and XRP is not one of them.\\r\\rJohnson, responding to this and alluding to recent reports that Ripple had attempted to bribe Coinbase with incentives such as an interest-free XRP loan to list the token, claimed that the exchange did not cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason for declining its offer.\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏCoinbase never ever raised the issue of whether or not XRP is a security in our discussions about listing XRP,\\x89Û\\x9d Johnson said. \\x89ÛÏWe\\x89Ûªre 100 percent clear, it\\x89Ûªs not a security. We don\\x89Ûªt meet the standards.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rFeatured image from Shutterstock.\\r\\r', 'A recent declaration by an Islamic scholar that Bitcoin is compliant with Sharia law could be the cause behind today\\x89Ûªs $1000 price surge, opening the market to Muslim investors who were previously unsure if the cryptocurrency qualified as money under the strict definitions outlined by scholars.\\r\\rMuslims account for 23% of the world\\x89Ûªs population, with 1.6 billion Muslims throughout the world, mostly in Asia Pacific nations like India and Indonesia. Sharia Law, or Islamic Canonical Law, prohibits the practice of lending money at high-interest rates, known as usury. Debate has raged since the popularity of Bitcoin in the Islamic Scholar community as to whether Bitcoin trading was a form of usury due to the volatility and huge profit and loss margins.\\r\\rAs the fastest growing religion in the world, Islam has become a central issue for financial authorities of late, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) holding their first formal discussion about Islamic banking needs last year. In Islam, commodities with an intrinsic value (gold, silver, salt) are considered currency. Fiat money actually stands on thinner ice than commodities when it comes to being considered Islamic money \\x89ÛÒ digital or paper money is usually only permitted if it is backed by a commodity of intrinsic value and at a fixed exchange rate. The gold standard allows for gold-backed currencies to be Sharia compliant, for example.\\r\\rBitcoin has been a difficult currency to quantify, acting as a commodity and a currency all at once. It does, however, fall under certain definitions of customary money in Sharia law \\x89ÛÒ anything that becomes widely accepted as currency by society or government mandate.\\r\\rMufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, a Sharia adviser and compliance officer at Blossom Finance in Jakarta,  published a paper on whether Bitcoin is Halal (permitted) or Haram (forbidden) on Tuesday 10 April.\\r\\rThe paper essentially ruled that in certain cases, Bitcoin can indeed be Halal, permitted.\\r\\rAn excerpt read:\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏIn Germany, Bitcoin is recognized as a legal currency and therefore qualifies as Islamic money in Germany. In countries such as the US, Bitcoin lacks official legal monetary status but is accepted for payment at a variety of merchants, and therefore qualifies as Islamic customary money.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rSharia has strong ideas about the preservation of wealth, something that has led ICOs and the volatile crypto-trading market to be viewed in a negative light. Bitcoin and blockchain technology, however, actually align well with Sharia ideology. Fractional reserve banking where ownership of the money involved is considered usury, which is forbidden. Because blockchain undeniably proves ownership, it is actually more compliant with Sharia than banking, and this was all included in the paper published by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar. The ruling comes only one day after a major Islamic scholar conference concerning cryptocurrencies, demonstrating that this has become a pressing issue among the Muslim population.\\r\\rAs Muslims account for almost 1 in 4 people in the world, the ruling could open up the market to many investors who were previously avoiding it for religious reasons, something that we may well already be seeing with the recent surge in Bitcoin value.\\r\\rFeatured image from Shutterstock.\\r\\r', 'This is a submitted sponsored story.

Partnering with Tech Bureau Europe, the family-operated Chronoswiss promises a sophisticated yet elegant marriage of Japanese technology and timeless Swiss design.\\r\\rIn total, five luxurious crypto watch design series has been introduced, each with only 101 pieces produced in a limited edition manufacture and only available through the Zaif cryptocurrency exchange.\\r\\rThe five ranges will take on conceived aspects of their individual cryptocurrency which include Bitcoin as the currency, NEM as the harvest, Ethereum as the contract, Zaif as the exchange and COMSA as the token.\\r\\rThe crypto range is based on its latest Flying Regulator Open Gear and the unusual Chronoswiss design. A design which features a dial, that doubles as a module board, onto which the train wheel bridges of skeletonized gears are mounted.\\r\\rThe crypto watches are distinguished by several features including a regulator movement with off-center hour and second displays, a central design element of their regulator mechanism, a technically integrated 3-D dial bearing a custom-made logo to reflect each crypto edition, an elaborately skeletonized second display and in the dial logo print.\\r\\rEach watch is painstakingly hand-crafted in the Atelier Lucerne and will also bear a hand-painted individual serial number to specify its limited production. On the back is a skeletonized, red gold-plated rotor with a crypto logo visible through a sapphire glass back. All this encased within solid stainless steel with ultra hard, scratch-resistant, diamond-like carbon coating (5.000 Vickers).\\r\\rWith modern flourishes designed to please the most demanding of aesthetics, these new Chronoswiss watches do not depart from a long-standing reputation of the highest-quality material and workmanship, with authentic touches and meticulous finishing accompanying each piece.\\r\\rAlready recognized for their quality and value, the Chronoswiss crypto watches will appeal to watch lovers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. In addition, their limited production numbers enhance their values as collectibles, appealing even more to avid collectors of luxury items.\\r\\rChronoswiss CEO Oliver Ebstein spoke of how necessity is the mother of invention, referring to how the company was founded during the quartz crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. While the crisis led to a decline in Swiss watchmaking, Chronoswiss defiantly developed purely mechanical watches, insisting on retaining tradition connected to vision, a belief that stands today.\\r\\rOliver believes cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are a dazzling aspect of the company\\x89Ûªs future. With its homage to cryptocurrencies, Chronoswiss aims to link the roots of traditional watchmaking with the digital revolution of new world currencies.\\r\\rThe limited edition Chronoswiss crypto watches can only be bought on auction via the Zaif cryptocurrency exchange, which will take place between April 13th to 27th, 2018.\\r\\rWatches will be listed in the same way as tokens, with customers placing bids as buy orders. For every model, the 101 highest buy orders will be filled, thus giving the respective bidders legal ownership of the watches.\\r\\rTo learn more, visit the Chronoswiss website and register as a user on Zaif exchange.\\r\\r', 'This is a submitted sponsored story.

This represents a single-day increase of 12 percent, one of the market\\x89Ûªs largest intraday rallies since December.\\r\\rThe Bitcoin price led the rally, surging more than $1,000 in less than an hour and briefly surmounting the $8,000 checkpoint. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $7,740 on Bitfinex \\x89ÛÓ a 24-hour gain of 11 percent \\x89ÛÓ and has a market cap of just under $130 billion.\\r\\rAnalysts largely attributed the precipitous surge to a \\x89ÛÏbear trap,\\x89Û\\x9d which occurs when futures and margin traders attempt to short an asset but have their positions liquidated due to a price increase, forcing them to buy at market prices to cover their position.\\r\\rMatthew Newton, an analyst at crypto brokerage eToro told CCN:\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏWhilst there has been some stability in the cryptocurrency markets over recent weeks, we\\x89Ûªve seen a record number of short positions building on major exchanges.

The Ethereum price, for instance, rose 10 percent on Bitfinex and is currently trading at $463. Ethereum now has a $45.5 billion market cap.\\r\\rThe vast majority of altcoins posted similar rallies, though the gains were far from evenly distributed and one large-cap altcoin \\x89ÛÓ sixth-ranked Litecoin \\x89ÛÓ trailed the index by a considerable margin.\\r\\rThe Ripple price made an 11 percent leap to $0.55, raising the third-largest cryptocurrency\\x89Ûªs market cap to $21.5 billion.

The ROCATI concretizes this need by distinguishing itself from other types of electronic money riding the wave of Bitcoin\\x89Ûªs success: this digital currency will grow through a concrete good: bricks and mortar. Its value will be consolidated with real estate transactions, and this means that there is no risk of the kind of speculative bubble that finance experts fear with other cryptocurrencies.\\r\\rFrom now on it will be easier to buy a house. A cryptocurrency has been born that will help young couples to buy a property and to transform old apartments into modern homes, revaluing them and reducing energy consumption. The Rocati is a currency that does not need an enormous use of electricity for its production, as is required by Bitcoin, and also through the project of restructuring houses it helps to reduce energy waste by protecting the environment. All this is possible with this new currency, which will see its debut on the market in April. The project stems from the intuition of Emanuele Pinzi, a young graduate in engineering with a specialization in interior architecture in the United States, who has brought together the needs of ordinary people and those of the real estate market: a new form of investment that anticipates the future.\\r\\rThe other cryptocurrencies have a purely speculative origin and it is normal that they are perceived as a high-risk investment. The ROCATI has the function of disengaging people from the banking intermediaries that with their own behavior have proved to be an unreliable channel. This currency is a financial instrument that has within it a social soul that is useful to the community.\\r\\rThe real estate sector is the most important lever of the economy, and restarting it is fundamental for all countries. Creating added value in this sector is essential to deliver into the hands of citizens the security they have lost in investing their savings. The ROCATI, in addition to defending the resources of workers and retirees, also beckons to investors who want to diversify their portfolios. The dream of young couples to create a family by sidestepping all the banking bureaucracy to get a mortgage is becoming a reality. This new method will significantly affect real estate transactions, increasing the GDP of countries, and redistributing wealth in a healthy way to consolidate the future of citizens.\\r\\rThe ROCATI is linked to Itarco, a network of real estate agencies supported by a company that will guarantee credit through the transferable compromise, a form of rent to buy that makes your home unassailable and will eliminate the rent charges paid by the majority of citizens in every country. This act makes the asset acquired inviolable, respecting the great value that the property represents. This procedure secures the financial resources of the buyer, ensuring full enjoyment of the property purchase. The person intending to buy a property will receive a mortgage equal to 100% of the value. The transparency of the operations is guaranteed by a software program through which the notary can register the deed directly on the blockchain of the currency. Those who buy ROCATI know that the currency\\x89Ûªs appreciation is linked to real estate transactions, not to speculation, and this brick of security will create conditions for a peaceful future.\\r\\rIn 2017 the value of real estate transactions in Italy amounted to \\x89âÂ 118 billion, with an increase of 14%, while in the world, this asset reaches the sum of 217 trillion dollars. According to surveys by real estate observatories, the Italian housing stock is rather obsolete, and only a quarter of households are contemplating renovation work. The ROCATI allows you to buy a house that will be revalued in a short time thanks to a restructuring carried out through a team of architects, at a cost divided into convenient instalments within the thirty-year mortgage.\\r\\r', 'The previous two years can be called the years of cryptocurrencies as in the past two years Bitcoin has reached every corner of the world. While the journey of cryptocurrencies continues; it is not as fast as before. There might be many reasons to this including timely regulations that are being exercised by various countries. These regulations are resultant of the fact that cryptocurrencies are independent of central authorities such as governments and banks owing to their decentralized nature.\\r\\rOn the other hand, there are some limitations associated with Bitcoin. Bitcoin can manage a mere seven transactions per second when credit card companies can process up to 100,000 transactions per second. The lack of suitability to mass market was the main reason why some developers got together to analyze and optimize the knowledge of previous cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin in 2012. A new, improved Blockchain has successfully been developed: The Infinity Economics platform and the XIN Coin. The Infinity Economics platform places great emphasis on transaction speed to ensure that XIN is used as a digital currency as XIN in practice. This is because coin transactions take place between two wallets. It works in the same way as that of a bank wire, but here, it is based on encrypted messages. The confirmation time for a transaction differs depending on the cryptocurrency and that is what making all the difference.\\r\\rOn January 10, 2017, 9 billion XIN Coins were generated by a Genesis process like that of a \\x89ÛÏbig bang\\x89Û\\x9d, and were distributed entirely to the largest founding community so far. Since then, the Infinity Economics platform has brought together the best of all blockchain developments. It builds the foundation for endless use cases on the blockchains. A very promising feature of the Infinity Economics platform is its automated transactions (AT), also known as smart contracts. These intelligent (smart) contracts are small programs that automatically fulfil the conditions of a contract according to a predetermined procedure (if-then-else-logic). They can be deployed on the Infinity Economics blockchain, and they have the potential to enable use of the Internet of things to the mass market.\\r\\rIt also facilitates Asset Exchange which permits the investment, purchase and sale of asset. This also permits the presentation of data beyond simple coin trading. This creates diverse new opportunities for businesses. The Asset Exchange Facilitation is based on the coloured coin concept, where a coin or a set of coins can be firmly designated to represent something else.\\r\\rThe Escrow Service in the platform enables secure payments by retaining the buyer\\x89Ûªs coins until the terms of the sale are met and the buyer releases the payment to the seller. This eliminates disputes, and removes needs of any further measures by third parties. The XIN tokens which are central to the platform facilitates anonymous transactions in less than 60 seconds with its secure wallet. Users can also create and send simple text messages within the decentralized blockchain. They can also replace system-defined names with your own texts to use key terms or phrases. The subscribed users get the liberty to terminate the recurring payment any time they want. It is quite obvious that the creation of additional funds (coins) act as basic building block of the monetary system on the Infinity Economics platform.\\r\\rAs far as new businesses are concerned, they can make use of Infinity Economics to finance existing or future projects in a novel and innovative way. Since its inception, Infinity Economics Platform has been a 100% community-led project which implies, the deciding power of all community members corresponds to their voting power. Voting is also done using consensus-based blockchain technology which enables completely transparent elections that are totally secure against counterfeiting, while ensuring the anonymity of each participant without having to rely on a central monitoring body. This approach essentially makes infinity economics a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). All the processes including platform development; marketing; documentation and everything else are organized in a decentralized manner. Therefore, the \\x89ÛÏpower\\x89Û\\x9d rests with the users \\x89ÛÒ the only consistent and fair approach for a blockchain as that is the only way to eliminate sources of error. The platform has been designed for users to decide independently of major investors, developers or founders.\\r\\rMedia Contact\\r\\rName : Abhimanyu Kumar\\r\\rEmail : marketing@infinity-economics.org\\r\\rPhone : +91-8817751713\\r\\r', 'Bytecoin, which is known to be one of the leaders in anonymous cryptocurrency, has made an intermediate summary regarding their Asian expansion and is moving forward with major updates in the Far East market.\\r\\rThe Asian cryptocurrency market has proven to be the area with the biggest potential in the blockchain world, according to several price and volume aggregators.

For users to access these services, secure identification will be required.\\r\\rOn Friday, 23 March 2018, Consentium also held its first sharing session in Singapore, with a turnout of 150 attendees. The event called \\x89ÛÏConsentium Presents: Regulations and Economics of Cryptocurrencies Today\\x89Û\\x9d covered information around the parameters of cryptocurrencies in Singapore. Speakers included Peter Sin and Caleb Yap, Co-Founders of Singapore Bitcoin Club, Nizam Ismail, legal advisor for Consentium, as well as Hal Bame, CEO & Co-Founder of Consentium, who shared more around the platform\\x89Ûªs unique concept of monetising the creation and participation of community chat groups.\\r\\rInsights from the packed-out event helped drive interest in Consentium\\x89Ûªs pre-sale, as its pre-sale cap of USD$20 million was achieved within the initial hours of the one-day pre-sale. To cater to the overwhelming interest registered, Consentium will be extending its public sale dates to run from April 15th (1800hrs GMT +6) through April 30th (1800hrs GMT +6).\\r\\rConsentium is the first chat application to reward its users with cryptocurrency for any group or community they create. The Consentium Coins (CSM) cryptocurrencies generated on the platform are based on the Ethereum platform, the world\\x89Ûªs largest leading smart contract blockchain.\\r\\rFor Media Enquiries\\r\\rPRecious Communications for Consentium\\r\\rT: (65) 6303 0567\\r\\rE: consentium@preciouscomms.com\\r\\r', 'Cryptocurrencies have performed exceptionally well in 2017 and are continuing to attract new investors in 2018. As regulators have become increasingly attentive to the cryptocurrency markets, restrictions have been placed on deposit-taking banks. \\x89ÛÏI want to invest in cryptocurrencies, but the issue in Bulgaria is the fiat withdrawals and deposits from bank accounts. Recently, banks blocked all transactions connected with cryptocurrency trading.\\x89Û\\x9d said one trader from Bulgaria.\\r\\rWhile many people find they have difficulties funding their account with fiat currency to a fiat-crypto exchange due to the restrictions on banks, some of them have already been using a more comfortable and faster way to trade \\x89ÛÒ the OTC Market. Recently, trading firms are adopting Skype to negotiate, buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. This is convenient for people who want trade large blocks, but it is not practical for an average person who wants to buy a small amount of cryptocurrencies. Besides, trust is an issue for skype settlements.\\r\\rHowever, an OTC exchange makes it secure and fast for a normal trader or a crypto beginner. It builds the trust in a trustless environment. You can think of an OTC exchange as an \\x89ÛÏeBay for Crypto\\x89Û\\x9d, where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies to and from others using fiat currencies. OTC cryptocurrency trading has been going on for years. For example, LocalBitcoins is the most well-known peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange. Users create advertisements with the price and the payment method they want to offer. They can also search for advertisements and prefered payment methods.\\r\\rOTCBTC is a cryptocurrency exchange platform developed with Rails. Founded in October 2017, it has grown rapidly since its launch and has reached hundreds of millions of dollars in trading volume, and pageviews, within two short months. This platform has its own token called OTB, which can be used to pay the fees on the OTCBTC platform. The deduction is automatically applied according to the current market price through the system. In Janauray 2018, the team launched crypto exchange. Users are able to trade various altcoins on the platform with BTC, ETH and USDT pairs. As OTCBTC continues to gain support from the community, it is becoming the leading OTC exchange in Asia.\\r\\rLocalbitcoins\\r\\rOTCBTC\\r\\rCryptocurrencies\\r\\rBTC\\r\\rBTC/ETH/BCH/USDT/LTC/EOS/ZCASH/QTUM and other cryptocurrencies.\\r\\r67 different currencies in total\\r\\rFees\\r\\rFree for buying & selling\\r\\r1% for posting an ad with completed trading\\r\\rFree for buying & selling\\r\\r0.3% for  ETH\\r\\r0.5% for others\\r\\rOther Discount / Membership\\r\\rNO\\r\\rMil member 0.1%\\r\\rMi2 member 0.2%\\r\\rOTB discount.

Reply in 5 mins\\r\\rCrypto Exchange\\r\\rNO\\r\\rYes\\r\\rSo, we can see that as the demand in the OTC Market increases, both exchanges could gain large trading volumes. They both provide a secure and fast way for fiat-crypto trading to investors across the word. Though Localbitcoins is currently the most well-known marketplace with various fiat currency support. The lack of improvement and certain limitations, as mentioned in the table, gives OTCBTC an edge over Localbitcoins in the near future.\\r\\rTo know more about the OTCBTC exchange and explore its features, please visit https://otcbtc.com/\\r\\rFind OTCBTC on\\r\\rTwitter: https://twitter.com/otcbtc\\r\\rTelegram: https://t.me/otcbtc_en\\r\\rBlog: https://medium.com/otcbtc\\r\\r', 'We are pleased to announce that ZODIAQ bank has become compliant with FATCA and has obtained a GIIN. This information is available via the IRS website found here.\\r\\rPreviously, in January 2018, the bank joined SWIFT (BIC value: CRYTKMK1), and the code is available on their website beginning since March 2018.\\r\\rFATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) is a US law that requires that foreign financial institutions (FFI) to report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service). This law seeks to enhance monitoring of assets and currency movements with a view to prevent money laundering and tax evasion by US taxpayers.\\r\\rUpon registration and approval, each FFI is assigned a GIIN (Global Intermediary Identification Numbers). From then onward, such institution can provide services legally to US citizens and businesses. As for ZODIAQ, now it can open accounts and carry out all kinds of banking transactions in fiat and cryptocurrencies.\\r\\rConnection to SWIFT is another important step toward the integration of ZODIAQ bank to the international banking industry. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) operated a network enabling its members to send and receive information about financial transactions. This network links more than 12 000 institutions and major corporations in 215 countries.\\r\\rSWIFT carries over half a million financial messages daily with a total amount of transactions estimating at several billion dollars.\\r\\rThis doesn\\x89Ûªt limit to bank-to-bank transfers and payments, but also includes securities, traveller\\x89Ûªs cheques, and other financial instruments.\\r\\rErik Shekhmametev, COO of ZODIAQ, said, \\x89ÛÏThis is the first case of a bank licensed for cryptocurrency operations to join FATCA and SWIFT. This fact proves legal compliance of our project and also indicates recognition by the international banking community.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rAt the moment, we open early access to apply to open an account in ZODIAQ banking system. To do this, fill out the form using the link.\\r\\rThis information is publicly available via the IRS website.\\r\\rSWIFT (BIC value: CRYTKMK1)\\r\\rFATCA apps.irs.gov/app/fatcaFfiList/flu.jsf\\r\\rZODIAQ\\x89Ûªs GIIN is TVFQ2C.99999.SL.174 (Crypto Bank Limited).\\r\\r', 'Vietnamese authorities have asked local ministries and the police to investigate two allegedly fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) that conned 32,000 investors out of a staggering $660 million.\\r\\rThe operators of the purported \\x89Û÷cryptocurrency\\x89Ûª startups fundamentally conducted multi-level marketing schemes, local news outlet Tuoi Tre News reports, pointing the finger at Pincoin and Ifan that claim to be from Dubai and Singapore respectively. The two startups raised money through initial coin offerings under the control of Ho Chi Minh-based Modern Tech, the alleged operator who claims to be the authorized local representative for the two schemes in the country.\\r\\rAn estimated 32,000 investors were persuaded into investing into the schemes that incentivized older investors to rope in new investors. In a further sign of a brazen ponzi fraud, Pincoin \\x89ÛÒ which claims to be an Ethereum standard ERC-20 token \\x89ÛÒ claims to offer investors returns of up to 40% every month on its website that is complete with a picture of a yellow Lamborghini.\\r\\rWhile details are scarce about the longevity of the two alleged scams, investors reportedly began to sense trouble after Modern Tech stopped paying commissions in Vietnamese dong, the country\\x89Ûªs fiat currency. Instead, they were paid in tokens which were never redeemable for cash, the report added.\\r\\rIt wasn\\x89Ûªt long before investors turned up at Modern Tech\\x89Ûªs office in downtown Ho Chi Minh to demand compensation from the company. The queries quickly turned to protests with dozens of disgruntled investors holding banners in front of the company including one that reads: \\x89ÛÏCryptocurrency \\x89ÛÒ the biggest multi-level scams, more than 15 trillion dong\\x89Û\\x9d ($658 million), pictures on social media showed.\\r\\rA report from local publication Viet Bao the owner of the building that housed Modern Tech said the company had \\x89ÛÏalready left and annulled its contract\\x89Û\\x9d in March. \\x89ÛÏNo one knows where they are moving now,\\x89Û\\x9d he added.\\r\\rA group of seven Vietnamese nationals are described as the \\x89Û÷masterminds\\x89Ûª of promoting the alleged scams across Vietnam including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, the country\\x89Ûªs two biggest cities.\\r\\rThe severity of the alleged scams, both in scale of its operation and the reported losses suffered by victims, has seen the office of Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Vietnam\\x89Ûªs Prime Minister, publish a directive ordering the State Bank of Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Securities and other authorities to reinforce and strengthen the management of \\x89ÛÏactivities related to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\\x89Û\\x9d.\\r\\rA separate statement from Vietnam\\x89Ûªs deputy prime minister Vuong Dinh Hue has ordered six governmental ministries to \\x89ÛÏquickly consider and take down\\x89Û\\x9d the scam.\\r\\rWhile Vietnam was reported to have been preparing to legalize legitimate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in mid-2017, the central bank has since enforced laws to prohibit the usage of bitcoin as legal tender in the country.\\r\\rFeatured image from Shutterstock.\\r\\r', 'Bitcoin Press Release: Ancora, the Italian manufacturer of high-end exclusive writing accessories, has launched its Cryptocurrency Pen series \\x89ÛÒ the world\\x89Ûªs first pens inspired by the top blockchain platforms of today.\\r\\r11th April 2018, Milan, Italy \\x89ÛÒ The pens manufactured under this brand are distributed along the lines of the Token Sale model, just like the coins and tokens of the cryptocurrencies they represent.

It currently posts a rate of over 800,000 bolivars per dollar. Venezuelans are turning to cryptocurrencies as the government has enforced strict foreign exchange controls back in 2003.\\r\\rThese controls see individuals and businesses who aren\\x89Ûªt able to obtain government approval to purchase dollars at legal rates turn to the black market. Cryptocurrencies help Venezuelans access foreign goods, and effectively survive government failures.\\r\\rLast year Jorge Farias, the co-founder of Venezuelan-based cryptocurrency brokerage Cryptobuyer, which had over 10,000 users at the time, said:\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏThe transaction takes a few minutes, our commission is three to seven percent lower than the banks, and our exchange rate is regulated by supply and demand, making it more realistic than the official\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rVenezuelans have limited access to official foreign exchange markets, which makes it hard to get a sense of what their fiat currency is worth.

The hyperinflation has left the country on the brink of economic collapse, a problem that the government seemingly isn\\x89Ûªt addressing.\\r\\rInstead, Venezuela\\x89Ûªs government is focusing on its oil-backed cryptocurrency the Petro (PTR), which recently received the \\x89ÛÏSatoshi Nakamoto Prize\\x89Û\\x9d from the Russian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association. The Petro, through its initial token sale, is said to have raised more than $5 billion from investors throughout the world.\\r\\rWhile the country\\x89Ûªs National Assembly and other entities bashed the Petro\\x89Ûªs sale, some analysts doubt it even exists. Meanwhile, the country has implied it may charge for exports in it and ordered state-owned businesses to accept it, which could create demand.\\r\\rAs for its economy, the executive secretary of the country\\x89Ûªs Blockchain Observatory, Daniel PeÌ±a, revealed he believes the oil-backed cryptocurrency will positively impact it within \\x89ÛÏthree to six months.\\x89Û\\x9d In an interview to the country\\x89Ûªs Cuatro F newspaper, he said:\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏThere are many advantages, among them is that the inflationary scheme of the Venezuelan economy breaks down.

CryptoKitties might not be the smash hit it was cracked up to be, but it might have been a more viable comparison considering it\\x89Ûªs built on the Ethereum network.\\r\\rAs Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin recently explained to CNBC, the value, at least for ETH, can be compared to commodities like oil, which trades for a price and \\x89ÛÏis a fuel that powers the global commerce platform. He said: \\x89ÛÏThe ether token is used to pay for computational steps and storage operations on the decentralized application platform that is Ethereum.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rMeanwhile, according to Bernstein, the difference between Candy Crush\\x89Ûªs in-game currency and the cryptocurrencies that bitcoin miners create and earn in exchange for solving complicated puzzles comes down to the fact that digital currencies can be traded. The speculative nature of trading cryptocurrencies qualifies the market for a bubble, says Bernstein, pointing to the following features of digital currencies as proof \\x89ÛÒ\\r\\rBernstein wouldn\\x89Ûªt be the first person to call cryptocurrencies a bubble, with some cryptocurrency market veterans having said in the past that not all of them will survive. And according to Bernstein\\x89Ûªs note, trading in a bubble doesn\\x89Ûªt discredit the economic and business case of cryptocurrencies, though it \\x89ÛÏsuggests that the return-on-investment could be considerably lower than investors currently expect.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rBernstein is a Wall Street veteran, having previously served as Merrill Lynch\\x89Ûªs chief investment strategist, and he\\x89Ûªs weighed in on bitcoin before. He can analyze equity market analysts under the table, but when it comes to cryptocurrencies, he\\x89Ûªs skeptical. Bernstein said in a note to clients in December:\\r\\r\\x89ÛÏIt is ironic that [investors] fear traditional equities, but they do not fear cryptocurrencies. One must remember that risk typically lies in what you\\x89Ûªre invested in, and not in what you fearfully avoid.\\x89Û\\x9d\\r\\rBitcoin\\x89Ûªs worth is derived from the value that people place on it, as it\\x89Ûªs not backed by any asset.

The former has frequently been accused of censorship for its moderation of posts related to the years-long Bitcoin scaling debate, while the latter \\x89ÛÓ of which Ver is a moderator \\x89ÛÓ has become the de facto subreddit for Bitcoin Cash. Both, meanwhile, have been accused of tribalism.\\r\\rVer\\x89Ûªs tweet attracted its own of replies \\x89ÛÓ and copycats.\\r\\rSome, like Bitcoin.org co-owner Cobra-Bitcoin, offered to pay for a moderator post on /r/BTC.

Last year, the company raised $200 million in funding, placing its total valuation at $1.8 billion.\\r\\rFeatured image from Youtube.\\r\\r', 'In this opinion piece, Janis Graubins, co-Founder of Identity and Access Management company Notakey, follows the trial of a suspicious cryptocurrency wallet address and explains if and how illicit activity can be combated.\\r\\rWe had the Wild West, where the cliche of the cowboy movies was the nearest sheriff is 90 miles away, and so you had to pack a gun and defend yourself. \\x89ÛÒSteven Pinker\\r\\rRegulators warn to be cautious, friends preach them as the next big thing. What\\x89Ûªs about cryptocurrencies? Are they solving real-life problems or are mainly used for money laundering? I will try to answer these questions in a series of articles.\\r\\rBut let\\x89Ûªs start with the first questions I typically get when starting to talk about cryptocurrencies \\x89ÛÓ if there is no central authority, who is responsible for fighting frauds? This is a very serious topic as things can go wrong even for experienced crypto investors such as Ian Balina:\\r\\rDoes it eventually come up to the banks that allow exchanging cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies? And do they have right systems in place to pick up potential illegal activity? Or is it the case of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, where crime syndicates laundered more than A$75m through CBA\\x89Ûªs systems.\\r\\rI will first identify a suspicious wallet address that I will analyze. Then I will look into how end controls could help and if there should be controls at the start? Then I will ask myself if any controls should be put in the first place and what would happen if there are not? And finally, I will sum everything up and provide practical information on what can be helpful for fighting criminal activities.\\r\\r1. Identifying a suspicious address: to understand what can we do right, we need to understand how things can be done wrong.\\r\\rTo understand what risks there are for potential money laundering in cryptocurrency space and if in case somebody would steal my funds I would be able to recover it, I started with taking one Ethereum address that according to comments is involved in several scams.\\r\\rAnd followed where the money goes to. From this account it was transferred to this one:\\r\\rMy initial thoughts were let\\x89Ûªs use an existing service such as Coinfirm to make sense of all the transactions in the address. And that was what I did:\\r\\rThe problem with the report, however, was that while it shows identified risks, it does not provide with context. Moreover, some of the risks that could be identified manually were not identified by Coinfirm at all:\\r\\rAnd these are just few. Others that were not identified were structured deposits, multiple output transactions, high-value addresses, ICO contributor etc. That is why I decided to continue with checking transactions manually.\\r\\r2. Can End controls stop money laundering? And what is Ethereum Mixer?\\r\\rWhen I looked further where the money flows from this account I was surprised that after being transferred to another account, it was split in smaller amounts and eventually sent to Shapeshift to lose tracks (Shapeshift is a company that allows exchanging one cryptocurrency to another).\\r\\rInitially, I thought that it might be done manually but after a while, I started to think that there might be an Ethereum Mixer involved. So what is it?\\r\\rOf course, it says it is all about privacy but who are we kidding here? What it does is take control of your wallet address, splits the amount and sends them to your end-address through other user accounts, newly created accounts and Shapeshift. This illustration sums it up nicely:\\r\\rAnd this is not one separate case. According to Satoshi fund research (they analyzed transactions that in a given period were equal to 68.5% in money terms) Ethereum Mixer counts for a large volume of all ETH transactions:\\r\\rBut let\\x89Ûªs get back to our case. As we can see from the illustration of top output addresses, the funds are sent to Exchanges like Kraken. It should be that at this point the money laundering stops because of their Know Your Customer (KYC)procedure at Exchange? It should if the KYC would be reliable.\\r\\rAnd it is not much better with Tier 3 verification. In particular, the problem with the implementation of KYC is \\x89ÛÓ it allows to allow upload photos of ID documents and yourself, instead of taking live photos.\\r\\rIn the cryptocurrency world, creating an account with fake identity takes seconds. So if somebody has access to your photo and ID documents, that person can impersonate you. And to be frank, data breaches where ID documents are leaked happen quite often.\\r\\r3. Do we need to look the other way around? Should we put controls in the beginning?\\r\\rFor this let\\x89Ûªs go back to the address we analysed. If we check from where the funds are coming from, we can see that they are from addresses that have received the funds by mining, participated in ICOs or bought and sold tokens through Exchanges.\\r\\rWe can see that the address has many small incoming transactions. If we check that address in details it becomes clear that the funds come from mining.\\r\\rThe only thing what is needed to mine ethereum or bitcoin is hardware that can be bought in any electronics shop. No KYC is required to join a mining pool. It basically means that there could be Government officials from North Korea mining bitcoin or ethereum and no one would know. They even would not need to buy hardware themselves as there are many services that sell hashing power for mining.\\r\\rLet\\x89Ûªs look first at Ubcoin ICO. Do they check from where the funds are coming from.\\r\\rAccording to their Telegram chat for funds below 50 eth (around $20k) it is not required to do any KYC at all. Money launderers could easily buy these tokens and then exchange to fiat currencies through Exchanges (when they are listed). Even better, they actually could create a fake ICO through which they launder the funds.\\r\\rSimilar situation is with ModulTrade token that already is listed and has a questionable KYC in place.\\r\\rAs it can be seen from the Telegram chat, it would be easily to impersonate another person as there is no face-matching in place.\\r\\rOf course, it is possible that both Ubcoin and ModulTrade have a solution for analyzing wallet transactions and in case the funds are coming from a source that looks suspicious, they might do enhanced due diligence. However, I could not find any information about that.\\r\\r4. Do we actually need to have any controls?\\r\\rI have talked a lot about downside of not having a KYC and not being able to track transactions due to Mixers, but what about cases where you are doing something legitimate but would still like to keep your privacy?\\r\\rFor example, let\\x89Ûªs say I own a brothel in Switzerland from which I get profit every month. In Switzerland this is legal. But if I would live in Russia, where it is illegal, I might be cautious about showing my source of income. The same logic applies to several other use cases \\x89ÛÓ e.g., if I would have a medical condition that requires buying medical marijuana that is allowed in one country but not in another.\\r\\rThere are several more use cases, where keeping privacy makes sense. That is why ideally KYC would be required only where there are risks of money laundering. Nevertheless, the question is how to do it if so many people are trying to hide their tracks?\\r\\r5. Why should I care?\\r\\rAs a company \\x89ÛÓ you should care because the fines for not complying with AML rules are very high. E.g. JP Morgan case, where the bank paid a fine of $ 1.7 billion. Regulators across the world are looking into if cryptocurrencies should also be subject to the same law. Even if operations with cryptocurrencies will no be subject to AML rules, still all company funds can be frozen in case there is an ongoing investigation for a bank that holds all money of the company. For a business that is trying to be the next Google, this is a completely unnecessary risk as all the operations of the company might be suspended for an unknown time period.\\r\\rFor individuals \\x89ÛÓ not filing a suspicious transaction report, might lead to criminal charges carrying jail sentences for reporting entities and their directors, officers, agents, and employees.\\r\\r6. What could help?\\r\\rThe first thing what needs to be done is set in place good KYC systems. With that I mean:\\r\\rTo sum everything up \\x89ÛÓ money laundering is possible but so is identifying these actions. Ethereum Mixers, ICOs and Mining Services make it more difficult to analyze if funds are not coming from a suspicious source, therefore, linking a wallet to a verified identity could help. Privacy is important, therefore ideal KYC solution should show that person has passed the check without revealing their identity.\\r\\rFeatured image from United Artists/The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\\r\\r', 'BTCTN : https://t.co/K1IkAykuk2 #hodlwaves https://t.co/pbmhhL7YMc (via Twitter https://t.co/deulHdXWwh)', 'Take on Ethical Hacking at Your Own Pace Without Having to go Thro https://t.co/2Fk9l5NeEa #Cybersecurity #Bitcoin', '#encryptotel Why is bitcoin worth money? https://t.co/KTpw1lYmtB https://t.co/5tBdhwBwqa', 'Are you looking for a serious, yet cost-effective Bitcoin miner?
