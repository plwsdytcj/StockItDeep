"Retailer Adoption of Bitcoin is Growing in the US and Canada, Despite Price Fall",1523124082,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Earlier this week, leading US electronics retailer Newegg expanded its bitcoin integration to its platform in Canada, allowing millions of customers based in Canada to pay for products with bitcoin.Increasing Retailer AdoptionNewegg CEO Danny Lee emphasized that the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed since 2014, when the company first integrated bitcoin, and noted that bitcoin users have significant purchasing power.â€œIn 2014 Newegg was among the first major companies to offer customers a bitcoin payment option. Since that time the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed and customers holding bitcoin have considerably more purchasing power. We believe the time is right to broaden our acceptance of bitcoin to our customers in Canada,â€ù added Lee.Stephen Pair, the CEO at BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that is responsible for handling bitcoin payments made to Newegg, also stated that the demand for cryptocurrencies from users in Canada has increased over the past few years, and Neweggâ€™s integration of bitcoin would allow the adoption rate of bitcoin to grow throughout the country.â€œWeâ€™re seeing a lot of traction in Canada, and weâ€™re happy to see Newegg extend its bitcoin payment option north of the border,â€ù said Pair.Other than Newegg, e-commerce platform Overstock, one of the worldâ€™s largest travel booking agency Expedia, eGifter, Gyft, satellite television service provider Dish, and CheapAir also accept bitcoin as a payment method.Factors of GrowthIn January, prior to the major correction of bitcoin, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz stated that the organization is willing to integrate a cryptocurrency in the future if it is retailer friendly and it is able to handle a certain capacity of transactions that is sufficient for large-scale conglomerates.During a conference call, Schultz stated that he personally does not believe bitcoin would be the global currency that will be adopted by retailers, but a cryptocurrency could be used in the future by retailers.â€œI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction,â€ù said Schultz.As Visa executive and Bitcoin Foundation co-founder Jon Matonis previously emphasized, the legitimacy of bitcoin as a global currency could continue to increase as major banks like Goldman Sachs and retailers like Newegg continue to adopt bitcoin as a payment method and a currency.Currently, the extreme volatility of the market makes it dififcult for retailers to fully adopt cryptocurrencies as a payment method. But, as the market grows and matures with public investment vehicles and more regulated investment channels, bitcoin could evolve into a global digital currency that is widely adopted by retailers.â€œI think itâ€™s fabulous that theyâ€™re getting into it because it brings in new liquidity. Theyâ€™re going to develop futures markets, options markets, I even think youâ€™re going to start to see interest rate markets around bitcoin. Weâ€™re used to hearing things about Libor, the index for bitcoin interest rates is Bibor,â€ù Matonis noted, emphasizing that the emergence of bitcoin-based investment vehicles would lead to overall improvement in liquidity and stability.Featured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/retailer-adoption-of-bitcoin-is-growing-in-the-us-and-canada-despite-price-fall/

"The Story of Alphacatâ€™s Founder, Dr. Bin Li",1523116298,"AdvertisementThis is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.It takes a special kind of person to create something uniquely revolutionary. Alphacatâ€™s founder Dr. Bin Li is definitely that.To see how he got to where he is today, letâ€™s take a look at the making of the man, from Liâ€™s early education right up until he created Alphacat.Notably gifted from an early age, Li was accepted into the prestigious China University of Science and Technology at just 16 years of age.While completing his studies, he caught the eye of Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, a Chinese American physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics. Dr. Lee recognized Liâ€™s potential and decided to sponsor his further education overseas.The young prodigy left for the United States and enrolled at New York University and in 1992, where he gained a Ph.D.Following the completion of his postdoctoral research at the highly regarded NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Dr. Bin Li was employed by investment bank Merrill Lynch. This marked the beginning of a successful career on Wall Street.Li quickly rose through the ranks of Merrill Lynch to become Vice President. Not content to rest on his laurels, Li also assumed the position of Director of Global Quantitative Trading Strategies Group.Li and five others formed the board of the of UBS North Americaâ€™s Executive Committee. In 2001, Li and his fellow board members created AASTOCKS.com, a popular financial web portal that grew to become the largest of its kind in Hong Kong.Li has also served as Chairman of Westport Financial LLC, the Chief Operating Officer of Ping Capital, the CIO of Yellow River Fund, and was the Senior Fund Manager at famous hedge fund Paloma Partners.But as successful as was in business, Li yearned for something more. He wanted to give everyday people the opportunity to discover the vast opportunities of investment, both within China and internationally.This ambition led to the creation of Alphacat. The AI cryptocurrency trading platform is revolutionary because it will allow everybody â€“ not just the ultra-wealthy â€“ to take advantage of its world-class trading robots.Li built a team of over 30 individuals with expertise in the fields of artificial intelligence, finance technology, machine learning, and blockchain technology.Since its inception, Alphacat has been reinventing the dynamics of cryptocurrency trading, giving ordinary traders the tools to make sound investments in an emerging market.Perhaps the best explanation of what Alphacat is all about comes from Bin Li, himself: â€œThe vision of Alphacat is to make quality investment advice more accessible for the average person by simplifying the whole cryptocurrency exchange process through a smart interplay of AI-driven robot advisors and analysis of big data to give a market prediction accuracy of 60% and aboveâ€ù.It takes an ambitious person to follow an ambitious dream and in Bin Li, Alphacat has just that. 2018 promises to be an exciting year for the project and with some big announcements coming soon, this is definitely one to watch.Media ContactTwitter: https://twitter.com/Alphacat_ioFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Alphacat.ioMediumï__https://medium.com/@AlphacatglobalTelegram ï__https://t.me/alphacatglobalWebsiteï__www.alphacat.io  Emailï__public@alphacat.io",1,https://www.ccn.com/the-story-of-alphacats-founder-dr-bin-li/
Blockchain Game Becomes the Main Topic in Global Blockchain Summit,1523116025,"AdvertisementThis is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.On April 3rd, 2018 Global Blockchain Summit was held ceremoniously in National Convention Centre, Beijing, and the Global Blockchain & Game Forum was hosted by World Blockchain Council (WBC) and co-hosted by GMGC and BIT.GAME. This forum gathered numerous entrepreneurs and leaders from blockchain and game industry, where they deeply communicated about subjects as the overturn that blockchain brings for traditional game industry, the development tendency for blockchain games, as well as rebuilding the credit value of game industry by blockchain. In view of this, some of them have given speeches to share their opinions, such as Eric Sun, CEO & Founder of BIT.GAME, and Owen Tao, CEO of Matrix AI Network, etc.In 2017, the actual sales revenue of game market exceeded 200 billion RMB in China. According to the latest analyst of Digi-Capital, the global hardware and software revenue within game industry has increased around $165 and $170 billion in 2018 as the market scale keeps expanding . While the fading dividend of population, IP and traffic have also brought a bottleneck for the future of game industry.While Blockchainâ€™s show-up may bring some new directions for all walks of life to the next level of development. The innovative decentralizing and distributed ledger technology makes it upgrade from information internet to value internet. As the first blockchain game CryptoKitties growing more and more popular, blockchain games seem to be another new engine of economic growth besides in financial industry, and itâ€™s also supposed to be the Ace in game industry, thus open a new gate for global game industry.  During the forum, blockchain experts not only introduced the development situation of blockchain,  but also the latest results and innovative ideas in building the game platforms. Eric Sun, as a professional game producer and the founder of BIT.GAME, delivered his speech in the forum regarding some main topics that game publishers care the most. He said, for a long time, CPs (Content Providers) as the craftsmen of game industry have always been on the low end of the value chain. For them, the combination of blockchain and game would be a rare but perfect chance, since this unique technology may bring challenges to all business.Based on the long-term study for game industry, BIT.GAME has produced a detailed research report on blockchain games, and brought up quite a few instructive point of views for the aspects of blockchain game developing as well as the development of underlying technology for blockchain.According to report, There are three stages before blockchain games go fully and widely spread: data mapping, data on chain and logic on chain. â€œNow it only supports to establish 1:1 mapping relationship between game data and token, and the total number of game coins is fixed. For the next stage, all the game data is supposed to be on chain and decentralized, which needs the support from the underlying logic and it still takes some time to achieve. The third stage is to popularize the smart contract, this allows all the players to have the access of checking the logic on chain, and activate the smart contract by simply playing the gamesâ€ù, Eric as the CEO and Founder of BIT.GAME said.Eric also mentioned that, there are two main problems for traditional game publishers to transfer into blockchain games, one is the high technique barrier, since itâ€™s quite difficult for game companies to find too many blockchain talents to proceed the projects; the other is the difficulty of monetizing the value, since the present exchanges are always set up with higher barriers, there is averagely superficial understanding of blockchain among game players, so there may lack of the mutual value on this game soil.In response to these issues, BIT.GAME produces a complete set of blockchain game solution with the help of its blockchain technology. Besides, BIT.GAME builds the first global blockchain game exchange, and also provides with a blockchain game incubation platform. All of these constitute the whole structure of BIT.GAME business.In the aspect of technology, BIT.GAME provides a set of development kits for traditional game developers in connection with public blockchain such as Ethereum, ABitChain, QTUM, Matrix AI Network etc, thus the games would be in line with BIT.GAME Exchange. Meanwhile, BIT.GAME devotes itself to forming the biggest assets transaction platform for global blockchain games, which allows players to do transactions through tokens. BIT.GAME also provides an incubation platform for blockchain games and offers with technical support and financial investment.â€œIt will only take as soon as 2 years to fully spread the blockchain technology to the whole world and make into full use.â€ù said Eric when talking about the future of blockchain games.During the forum, there was also a league called GBGU (as Global Blockchain Game Union) announcing established, and held ceremony in the forum. GBGU consists of BIT.GAME, ForGame, TrustNote, ABitChain, Matrix AI Network etc. GBGU aims to unite all the resources and provide technical support and platform service jointly, thus to proceed the development of blockchain and game industries, as well as to infill the new energy for the stable growth of game industry.For More information:Official Website: https://bit.gameE-mail: sns@bit.gameFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BitGameENTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitGameENTelegram: https://t.me/BIT_GAME_PROJECTGithub: https://github.com/BitGameEN",1,https://www.ccn.com/blockchain-game-becomes-the-main-topic-in-global-blockchain-summit/

Monetising Your Data with Datareum Decentralised Data Marketplace : Introducing Datareum ICO,1523114993,"AdvertisementThis is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.Bitcoin Press Release: Introducing Datareum, the decentralized data market, where users take ownership of and monetise their data. The Datareum token pre-sale begins April 28th, 2018.April 3rd, 2018, London, UK â€“ In the information age, data is one of the most valuable resources on the planet; personal user data is being sold in enormous volumes for enormous profits and often, without the consumerâ€™s consent or knowledge. Itâ€™s an invasive and archaic and invasive practice â€“ the data brokering industry leverages consumer data as an economic asset. Our behaviours, interests, preferences, age, location and gender are being monetized with absolutely no return for the consumer.Big MoneyAt present, large international organizations and companies are benefiting from the $200 Billion worth of sophisticated data sets available; the industry is dominated by huge companies like Equifax who own the data sets of 800 Million individuals worldwide, those data sets brought in $3.16 Billion for Equifax in 2016 alone.Other larger companies such as Facebook and Google make billions more from the complex data sets gathered from our online habits; most of this data is walled off and sealed away, out of the reach of individuals and researchers who could benefit significantly from the data beyond that of just monetary value. Datareum is positioning itself to be a disruptive force in this once sided market and are bringing power to consumers through a decentralized data marketplace.Datareum is creating an opportunity for society to take control of their data and sell it or give it way; through a fair and transparent data marketplace, data providers are incentivised to produce and provide high-quality data. Data purchasers on the other hand now have access to data, for lower costs thanks to complete elimination of intermediaries.Key Components of DatareumThe Datareum platform is made up of a few key components: for starters, Requesters are those who request of purchase data, and they may commission a survey directly or purchase survey results that have already been resold on the data marketplace. Providers are those who give away data for free or sell it, though they may previously be requesters who are providing data through resale.The Data Marketplace is where smart contracts determine the legitimacy of data entered on to the platform, and it also confirms whether or not the data is delivered of rejected and if so it completes the exchange or payment between the two parties.

There is a gap in the market for a platform which takes itâ€™s usersâ€™ security seriously, whilst providing innovative services that can be accessed on the go. This is where Investa comes in. Leveraging Blockchain technology and smart-contracts, Investa will provide a host of features designed to optimise user experience across a multitude of services, designed with the user in mind.Investa will offer Crypto Debit Cards, an ICO ETF Basket, the Investa Launchpad, the Investa Enterprise Funding Platform, a Crypto ATM Network, an e-Wallet, as well as the INV Exchange Platform.

Arizonaâ€™s Corporate Blockchain Bill Becomes Law,1523114083,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Arizona just advanced its ranking among blockchain-friendly states, bringing corporations one step closer to submitting all of their data on distributed ledger technology.Governor Doug Ducey has signed House Bill 2603, or the Corporations/Blockchain Technology bill, as an amendment to the Arizona Revised Statutes, which already supports â€œsignatures and records secured through blockchain technology and smart contracts.â€ù With the amendment, data thatâ€™s stored and shared by corporations on the blockchain also becomes valid.Arizonaâ€™s blockchain bill was first introduced to the House in February and passed the State Legislature in a matter of weeks. HB 2603 received strong support from lawmakers, including unanimous support from the Senate and only a handful of â€œnayâ€ù votes in the House. The bill was transmitted to Governor Duceyâ€™s desk in late March, where he signed it into law on April 3.â€œThe goal is to allow in a couple years for corporations to submit their records on a blockchain,â€ù Representative Jeff Weninger, the sponsor of the bill and a champion for blockchain innovation in the state, told a local news publication.Last year at about this time, Rep. Weninger introduced the law that recognized blockchain-fueled signatures and smart contracts as valid, which really set in motion the innovation that would follow from policymakers looking to catapult their state as a hotbed for innovation.Another Weninger bill is the Running Nodes/Blockchain/Regulation Prohibition act, which would block cities from preventing an individual â€œfrom running a node on blockchain technology in a residence,â€ù or cryptocurrency mining. Rather, he believes itâ€™s a decision that should be made at the state level.Meanwhile, northwest of Arizona in Washington, the pendulum is swinging to the other side, where local policymakers have placed a moratorium on bitcoin mining applications for the time being.Arizona and FintechThe Southwestern state has taken a leadership position with blockchain, and they have more innovation ahead. Rep. Weninger is co-sponsoring a bill to allow tax payments in bitcoin. The tax bill is taking a bit longer to make its way through the Legislature, but it could be a model for other states to adopt if it passes.The state is looking to fintech more broadly to bolster the economy, as evidenced by the fintech regulatory sandbox that became a reality last month. It gives entrepreneurs the ability to come to the state and focus on testing their products without the cumbersome legal regulatory fees and expenses that typically accompany innovation.Featured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/arizonas-corporate-blockchain-bill-becomes-law/

Dynatiq is set to be the backbone of the domain industry.05 April 2018, Dubai, UAE: As of January 1, 2018, a total of global internet users was approximated to be 3,812,564,450 as compared to 3.42 billion that was recorded in 2016. Asia has always been the continent with the highest number of internet users in the world however their recent percentage dropped from 50.1% to 49.7%. Europe has 17.0%. Latin America has 10.4% and Africa has 10%. North American only has 8.2%.In Asia, China has 738,539,792 users while the United States has 286,942,362 users. Russia has 109,55,842 users while Latin America has 18,526,199 users. Research also shows that North America has the highest penetration rate with a total of 88.1% of its people using the internet. In addition to this, Google now has over 6,586,013,574 searches per day worldwide.Research also shows that digital marketing will generate 44% or approximately $237 billion globally in 2018. Search advertisements are the most popular digital advertisement that is available now as the expenditure of marketers in 2018 reaches 12% with a total of $113 billion spent.In the first quarter of 2017, there were 1.3 million new domain names that were registered which is a 3.7% increase from the previous year. The .net and .com had a total of 143.6 million domain name registration by the end of 2017.The Dynatiq AdvantageDynatiq will never store a users data on a centralized marketplace, with an aim to protect data with the transparent and secure technology that is blockchain. Dynatiq technology uses escrow on a blockchain based marketplace. This escrow will provide various advantages to people who transact with it. Regardless if it is a website or domain sale, the use of escrow on the blockchain based marketplace will ensure that all buyers and sellers are equally protected thereby giving them an opportunity to settle their disputes with utmost concern.Users are familiar with buying things online you must have come across a typical online review. An aggregate star rating for your website or domain marketplace will help the upli!ment of a business. Even though customer reviews range in thoroughness and comprehensibility, they can have an adverse effect on audience attractionThe staking process will enable the general public to acquire tokens, especially during the crowdfunding stage. A certain percentage of the generated funds will be channeled to operations pool in order to provide merchants with the amounts of tokens that will be paid out as rewards to customers. The idea of selling these tokens to merchants will be solely dependent on the situation. Whenever customers make purchases at participating merchants, the tokens will end up in the hands of customers. The customers will make the decisions on whether to trade it or redeem it. The token can be properly used after the successful launching of the platform.Visit the Website: https://dynatiq.comRead the Whitepaper: https://dynatiq.com/whitepaper.pdfJoin on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Dynatiq-346748242496542/Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dynatiqLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdaluzza/Media Contact: Dynatiq FounderName: Abd al UzzaLocation: Dubai, United Arab EmiratesEmail: info@dynatiq.comDynatiq is the source of this content.

SEC Chair: Not All ICOs Are Frauds,1523113236,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said contrary to speculation, the SEC does not believe that all initial coin offerings are fraudulent.â€œAbsolutely not,â€ù Clayton said when asked if the SECâ€™s recent crackdowns on ICOs signals such a stance. Clayton made the remarks during a speech on â€œCryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offeringsâ€ù at Princeton University on April 5.Clayton said stamping out fraud in the crypto market is critical to protect consumers. He also said increased regulatory scrutiny will actually benefit the industry by ridding it of fraudsters and scam artists who give the entire space a bad name.And driving out bad actors early on will ensure that the government wonâ€™t eventually adopt such a hard-line stance that it will effectively choke off the budding industry, Clayton reasoned.SEC chairman Jay Clayton. (C-Span)  â€œIs the approach taken in Washington by the SEC adversely affecting distributed ledger technology in other areas? My hope is that itâ€™s actually helping, because this technology is being used for fraud,â€ù Clayton said. â€œAnd to the extent that itâ€™s being used for fraud, history shows that government comes down harshly on that technology later.â€ùHe added: â€œIf we donâ€™t stop the fraudsters, there is a serious risk that the regulatory pendulum â€“ the regulatory actions â€“ will be so severe that they will restrict the capacity of this new security.â€ùIn February 2018, Clayton signaled that his agency would investigate cryptocurrencies when he testified before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. At the time, he said: â€œI believe every ICO Iâ€™ve seen is a security.â€ùWeeks later, the SEC targeted ICOs by issuing â€œdozens of subpoenasâ€ù to crypto-related tech companies and advisors to investigate how ICOs are structured.$32 Million ICO Halted For FraudOn April 2, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas, the co-founders of Centra Tech.Sharma and Farkas are accused of raising $32 million by selling â€œunregistered securitiesâ€ù during the Centra ICO, which was promoted by boxing champ Floyd Mayweather and record producer DJ Khaled.Meanwhile, the SEC is now considering two bitcoin exchange-traded funds â€” the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF â€” for listing on the NYSE Arca, the first all-electronic exchange in the United States, according to public documents.Cboe President Urged SEC To Allow Crypto ETFsThe SEC consideration of bitcoin ETFs comes shortly after Cboe president Chris Concannon urged the agency to allow crypto ETFs.In a March 23 letter to the SEC, Concannon dismissed criticism that virtual currencies are too illiquid and volatile to be treated like other established commodities.â€œBecause of its innovative features as a digital asset, bitcoin has gained wide acceptance as a secure means of exchange in the commercial marketplace and has generated significant interest among investors,â€ù Concannon wrote.Cboe president Chris Concannon to SEC: Give bitcoin a chance. (YouTube)Concannon also said there is enough â€œreliable price informationâ€ù from the bitcoin futures market on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME that should ease regulatory worries about its opaqueness as an investment vehicle.â€œThere is real-time trade data available 24 hours a day from a number of different trading platforms around the world, with a collective volume in the billions of dollars daily,â€ù Concannon said. â€œBetween these various potential pricing sources, there is more than sufficient information for cryptocurrency ETPs to create reliable and robust valuation methodologies for bitcoin and potentially for other cryptocurrencies.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/sec-chair-not-all-icos-are-frauds/

A strategic plan of international expansion. BigBitcoin will cover the largest markets in the Asian region to lay a solid foundation for the token.05 April 2018. China: In modern world, the status of global economy based on Asia, while in the blockchain area, the largest mining industry chain is in China. The volume of digital assets of the three countries (China, Japan and South Korea) occupies more than half of digital assets in the world.In this case, BBC first launched on the six international digital asset trading platforms, giving priority to the layout of Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian economies, which is closely related to the reason mentioned above.It is undeniable that the dividend of the rapid development of Chinese economy is firstly shared by the surrounding Asian countries, which benefit from the geography factor. The development of the economy means the increase of leisure funds in the hands of people and the increase of their desire for investment. The prospect of block chainâ€™s development and the investment value of the digital assets drive this region to be the focus.BBC came into being from BTC and took the lead in this trend. The most concentrated volume of business in Asia and North America laid the foundation for subsequent global circulation and decentralization operation. BBC dares to have such ambition is because of its own strength.After the Bitcoin ForkBigBitcoin has completed the Bitcoin fork on 13th February, with the block size of 16M and the block time of 2.5 minutes. It completed the docking of Bitpie and Bitgo wallets, and cooperated with several media and projects to successfully finish the first round of publicity and hold the candy activity.According to the analysis of BBC bifurcation block data, there are 60% of BTC users receiving BBC, while there are more than 10 million BTC users around the world. BBC has acquired a large number of users from the BTC community by means of a bifurcated distribution.In addition, cooperation between BBC foundation and teams such as ETChain community, Bitpie community, Cloud chain community, Italy and other European and American teams are expected to add 1 million cash users to BBC community in March. In order to support the follow-up development and the maintenance of related community, BBC management big bitcoin foundation has invested mining machines to start mining.BBC from mining will be used to encourage the community, to support new excellent project on the main network, and to help the publicity of outstanding project by project candies.The block size of BBC16M is 16 times more than that of BTC 1M, and the block time (2.5 minutes) is 4 times more than that of BTC (10 minutes). At the same time, BBC also supports segregated witness, lightning network and graphene technology. For mass transactions and high concurrency, it can provide reliable and effective technical support for speed and data throughput capability.In addition, the BBC team also pioneered the chain matrix model. When dealing with high concurrent transactions, the BBC main chain will automatically create chain matrixes that are local parallel chains, and each of them inherits the characteristics of the BBC main chain. The local parallel chain can even reach the confirmation speed of millisecond, which improves the performance of the BBC main chain at multiples. Therefore the payment speed can reach the level in Taobao Double eleven, which is a unique precedent in other BTC bifurcations.Upgrades All RoundThere are two adjustments in the mining model: one is to adjust the difficulty of the proof of workload (PoW), which can enable the miners to transfer freely from the traditional BTC to the BBC; the other is to add Equihash algorithm on the basis of the sha256 algorithm so as to disperse the mining patterns by the use of GPU. These two methods can not only improve the efficiency of BBC mining, but also ensure the fairness.Visit the Website: http://bigbitcoins.orgRead the Whitepaper: http://bigbitcoins.org/files/BigBitcoin-BBC-WhitePaper.pdfChat on Telegram: https://t.me/bbcgroupsMedia ContactName: Andrew MasoLocation: BeijingEmail: Media@bigbitcoins.orgBigBitcoin is the source of this content.

"Swiss Startup Kasko2go Launches Worldâ€™s First Blockchain-Based Auto Insurance App, Where Safe Drivers Receive Low-Cost Insurance",1523112589,"AdvertisementThis is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.Bitcoin Press Release: Kasko2go is launching the markets first blockchain-based auto insurance application. The swiss-based company use military grade AI tech and telematics to provide safe drivers with a decentralized  app that accepts cryptocurrency payments for their car insurance.April 4th, 2018, Zug, Switzerland â€“ Swiss-based blockchain startup kasko2go uses military grade AI technologies, advanced telematics and a  experienced team of professionals to offer new low-cost driving insurance. The company have perfectly tailored their blockchain technology to develop an application that offers driver a simple, safe and affordable insurance solution with unprecedented transparency.The first blockchain-based auto insurance app kasko2go will start accepting payments in cryptocurrency beginning April 30th, 2018.

Classical insurance entities pay up to $500 in order to pitch new customers. By using blockchain and token-based mechanics, kasko2go aims to acquire one million new customers in the next three years.Kasko2go tokens serve as a tool for the encouragement of new clients, retaining the existing ones as well as the effective reduction of CAC by ten times. According to kasko2go financial plan, the CAC budget is comprised of 100 million tokens for encouragement program, EUR 5.7 million intended for traditional marketing expenses within CAC. The budget is targeted at the acquisition of 400 million customers, which would cost EUR 200 million in traditional insurance CAC.The Kasko2go team has elaborated mathematical model implying limited quantity of tokens in blockchain turnover. The demand for currency grows due to tokens turnover within encouragement program. Thus, token becomes an attractive asset on the stage of demo version usage of the app. Growing demand for tokens will gradually shorten the engagement program meanwhile the number of users will reach the point of 1 million.The Kasko2go TokenKasko2go token (K2G) will be the fuel of the kasko2go ecosystem used by customers and kasko2go third-party business partners worldwide.

Billionaire Mark Cuban Hates Bitcoin and Gold Equally: â€˜Iâ€™d Buy a Pet Rock Firstâ€™,1523110037,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Tech billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, hates both gold and bitcoin, saying theyâ€™re not viable alternatives to currency.â€œI hate gold. Gold is a religion,â€ù Cuban told Kitco (video below). â€œI do not see gold as an alternative to currency. Not at all. Letâ€™s put it this way: I donâ€™t see people in Puerto Rico carrying around big bags of gold to try to save things.â€ùCuban said both gold and bitcoin derive their values from supply and demand, but have no inherent value. He said â€œhateâ€ù is not strong enough a word to capture his antipathy for gold.â€œHate with extreme prejudice, with an ounce of hot sauceâ€ù is how the billionaire star of â€œShark Tankâ€ù says he feels about gold, and by extension, bitcoin.â€œI see gold and bitcoin as being the same thing,â€ù he said. â€œTheyâ€™re book collectibles. Their value is based off of supply and demandâ€_Iâ€™d sooner buy a pet rock.â€ùCuban added: â€œThe good news about bitcoin is that thereâ€™s a finite supply thatâ€™ll ever be created, and the bad news about gold is that theyâ€™ll keep mining more.â€ùFans Can Buy Mavs Tickets With BitcoinDespite Mark Cubanâ€™s bearish stance on bitcoin, he will allow fans to use bitcoin to pay for tickets to Dallas Mavericks games starting next season.Cuban made the revelation on Twitter in January 2018 in response to a fan who asked: â€œMark, when will I be able to purchase Mavs tickets with bitcoin?â€ù He replied: â€œNext season.â€ùâ€œWe will be adding a crypto payment ability,â€ù Cuban said (via CNBC). â€œWe will accept BTC, ETH, possibly some other currencies. [Thatâ€™s] to be determined.â€ùMark Cubanâœ”@mcubanReplying to @iamabitcornNext season.3:18 AM - Jan 16, 2018811349 people are talking about thisTwitter Ads info and privacyInterestingly, Cuban â€” whose net worth reportedly tops $3.7 billion â€” owns bitcoin and has invested in the cryptocurrency industry, but warned fans about throwing their money behind speculative investments such as crypto.Cuban has long been skeptical of bitcoin because of its erratic price swings based seemingly on nothing. â€œItâ€™s still very much a gamble,â€ù he told Money. â€œIt could go to $15,000 or zero, and maybe both on the same day.â€ùCuban is right. Bitcoin prices are prone to wild, unexpected swings. After scoring an all-time high of $19,000 in December 2017, BTC prices have tanked below $7,000 this week. But keep in mind that BTC hovered at just $1,000 in January 2017.Only Invest in BTC If You Can Handle Losing It AllFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said bitcoin prices crashed recently because U.S. investors were rapidly selling off their crypto holdings to avoid paying capital-gains taxes.But Lee, a noted bitcoin bull, projects BTC will rise again after Tax Day passes on April 17. Is that a given? As with anything crypto, the answer is: Nope, weâ€™ll have to wait and see.Cuban said you should invest in virtual currencies only if you can handle losing all the money.â€œIf youâ€™re a true adventurer and you really want to throw the Hail Mary, you might take 10% and put it in bitcoin or ethereum,â€ù he said. â€œBut if you do that, youâ€™ve got to pretend youâ€™ve already lost your money.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/billionaire-mark-cuban-hates-bitcoin-and-gold-equally-id-buy-a-pet-rock-first/
Wall Street Banker Quits to Advise ICO Startups â€“ Report,1523107077,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Brian Wirtz must have been a fish out of water at Credit Suisse Group AG. The investment banker for the bankâ€™s tech, media and telecom group was more interested in evangelizing cryptocurrencies than he was traditional deals, and most likely that made him the odd man out at a firm as traditional as Credit Suisse.Wirtz is leaving the Swiss bank where he was employed for nearly five years to start his own venture advising ICO companies with a focus on those issuing security tokens, according to Bloomberg.According to his LinkedIn profile, Wirtz in his role at Credit Suisse was an â€œinvestment banker focused on helping crypto core teams achieve their strategic missions.â€ù Wirtz previously described himself as the head of blockchain advisory at the bank, which should serve him well when advising ICO startups. He further calls himself a â€œdirector blockchain, cryptoasset, investment banking,â€ù but the bank couldnâ€™t contain his ambitions.Hereâ€™s what you should know about Wirtz â€“Heâ€™s been engaged with bitcoin since 2012He â€œbrought it with him to Credit Suisse in 2013â€ùHe fought for six months  to sign a bitcoin mining company at the bankHis move to advise ICO startups is a boon for the industry. Heâ€™s previously explored themes such as where the industry is in the cycle as compared to the rise of the internet as well as how companies should be investing in blockchain technology.Security-Token ICOsAs far as Wall Street banks go, Credit Suisse is on the outskirts of the nascent crypto market, having hosted cryptocurrency conferences for institutional investors in major US cities that inspired hundreds of bitcoin enthusiasts. Even Wirtz once said that Credit Suisse â€œwas leading the charge among bulge brackets for cryptocurrencies.â€ùBut Wirtz is setting out for green pastures, with plans to launch a startup seemingly to advise security-token ICOs, which gives more regulatory heft to the deals versus utility tokens.Itâ€™s a step that should bolster confidence among ICO issuers, as a banker who has been engaged with major tech deals is lending his experience to new coin issuance, where regulators have been circling amid a Wild West environment. Heâ€™s accustomed to working with regulated securities and therefore will provide a certain amount of compliance that quite frankly the market probably needs.Wirtz gave Credit Suisse the opportunity to become more engaged with cryptocurrency-fueled deals, according to the report. But for all of his good intentions, Wirtz couldnâ€™t accomplish all he wanted within the confines of a major investment bank and a CEO, Tidjane Thiam, who is still apprehensive about cryptocurrencies. Credit Suisse is investing in blockchain, but so is JPMorgan, and the league tables have yet to identify the rankings among cryptocurrency deals.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/wall-street-banker-quits-to-advise-ico-startups-report/
"Bitcoin Price Increases by 4%, Eyes Move to $7,000 as Market Gains $19 Billion",1523099150,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has gained $19 billion, from $248 billion to $257 billion, as major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and Ethereum recovered from their recent losses, as bitcoin price rose 4%.Bitcoinâ€™s RiseOn April 6, the bitcoin price fell from $7,000 to $6,500. Traders were anticipating a potential drop to the yearly bottom at $6,000, as bitcoin price remained at the $6,000 mark for several hours before rebounding to $6,600. If the bitcoin price had not rebounded from that level and sustained the $6,500 mark, the price of bitcoin could have dropped to the $6,000 mark.However, as time passed, bitcoin started to demonstrate some buy volumes, and it picked up momentum on April 7. Eventually, within a 24-hour span, the bitcoin price increased from $6,500 to $6,950.The 15-minute candle chart of bitcoin on April 6 evidently showed the end of its corrective rally from $6,600 to $7,500, which could have been key to bitcoinâ€™s short-term recovery towards the $8,000 region. In the upcoming days, bitcoin could eye the $8,000 region if it can rise back again to $7,500 and test the $7,800 level.Throughout today, bitcoin has shown some signs of recovery, and if this rally takes bitcoin to the $7,000 region, it is likely that bitcoin could eye the $7,500 mark, as it had earlier this week.Generally, the market has also become optimistic towards the entrance of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. In December, investors expected a wave of retail traders to enter the bitcoin sector through the bitcoin futures market. But, volumes on the bitcoin futures market have been virtually non-existent, and the demand from institutional investors from the west has been a disappointment.This week, George Soros and Soros Fund, a fund founded by the legendary $8 billion investor, announced that it is preparing to trade cryptocurrencies, as Bloomberg reported. Over the past three months, several large hedge funds like Fortress have exited the space. If new capital comes into the market in an extremely volatile period like this, it could help bitcoin to recover from its previous losses.â€œAdam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade virtual coins in the last few months, though he has yet to make a wager, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman declined to comment,â€ù read Bloombergâ€™s report.OntologySince April 4, Ontology has been the best performing alternative cryptocurrency against bitcoin. WIthin a three day span, the value of Ontology has nearly doubled against bitcoin on Binance, the worldâ€™s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Several altcoins such as ICON have also performed well against bitcoin, leading to excitement within the cryptocurrency space.Still, although several altcoins have outperformed bitcoin in the past few days, it is uncertain whether the altcoin season will arrive in the short-term. SInce January, bitcoinâ€™s dominance over the cryptocurrency market has intensified, and it will likely increase as new capital flow into the space.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-increases-by-4-eyes-move-to-7000-as-market-gains-19-billion/
Central Bank Digital Currency Could Go Live This Year: R3 Research Director,1523095832,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.A form of central bank issued digital currency (CBDC) could go live this year, according to Antony Lewis, R3 director of research, cash and CBDC strategy, speaking on panel of experts at the Deconomy conference this week at the Walkerhill Hotel in South Korea.All panelists speaking on â€œIndustry Evolution Through Distributed Ledgerâ€ù were hopeful that CBDC will be launched for select financial institutions.Lewis believes that blockchain technology will be used by select financial institutions.Central Banks Voice Supportâ€œWe have had conversations with central banks who have mandates to fix certain payment problems, and one solution they look to is a blockchain type of platform,â€ù Lewis said, according to a report posted by Korea Coin on YouTube.Lewis said this does not mean consumers will have a new payment choice that functions like bitcoin or Ether. Instead, Lewis predicted that only select financial institutions would use such a cryptocurrency to start.Such a system would likely even be used in situations such as disaster recovery, he said.â€œDonâ€™t make your secondary (decentralized) system look like your primary (centralized) system,â€ù Lewis said. Otherwise, if a primary system goes down in an attack, the attackers would only need to play the same trick.â€œThen itâ€™s not resilience, itâ€™s just another IP address to attack,â€ù he said.Application To Commercial BankingPanelist Stanley Yong, global CBDC lead at IBM and a former CBDC researcher at Singaporeâ€™s central bank, agreed that a blockchain system will eventually be best applied to commercial banking and was hesitant about its application to consumers.â€œIf it issues cryptocurrency to millions and billions of citizens, it will have to hold all these individual accounts, which inherently increases the market and credit risks,â€ù Yong said.Also read: R3, 22 member banks develop instant cross-border payments platformCentral Banks Have Specific RolePanelist Ian Grigg, a financial cryptographer, said it might not even be the fundamental role of central banks to issue a retail CBDC.The Bank of England, for example, supports the deposit of commercial banks, Grigg said. Hence, directly issuing a cryptocurrency to the public could undermine existing commercial banksâ€™ deposit base, ultimately impacting the loan market, he said.The Bank of International Settlements previously stated that a CBDC could give rise to â€œhigher instability of commercial bank deposit funding.â€ùThe panelists were hopeful that blockchains will replace existing banking technology.Yong went as far as to state such systems are â€œdue for retirement.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/cbdc-could-go-live-this-year-r3-research-director-claims/
"Retailer Adoption of Bitcoin is Growing in the US and Canada, Despite Price Fall",1523124082,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Earlier this week, leading US electronics retailer Newegg expanded its bitcoin integration to its platform in Canada, allowing millions of customers based in Canada to pay for products with bitcoin.Increasing Retailer AdoptionNewegg CEO Danny Lee emphasized that the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed since 2014, when the company first integrated bitcoin, and noted that bitcoin users have significant purchasing power.â€œIn 2014 Newegg was among the first major companies to offer customers a bitcoin payment option. Since that time the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed and customers holding bitcoin have considerably more purchasing power. We believe the time is right to broaden our acceptance of bitcoin to our customers in Canada,â€ù added Lee.Stephen Pair, the CEO at BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that is responsible for handling bitcoin payments made to Newegg, also stated that the demand for cryptocurrencies from users in Canada has increased over the past few years, and Neweggâ€™s integration of bitcoin would allow the adoption rate of bitcoin to grow throughout the country.â€œWeâ€™re seeing a lot of traction in Canada, and weâ€™re happy to see Newegg extend its bitcoin payment option north of the border,â€ù said Pair.Other than Newegg, e-commerce platform Overstock, one of the worldâ€™s largest travel booking agency Expedia, eGifter, Gyft, satellite television service provider Dish, and CheapAir also accept bitcoin as a payment method.Factors of GrowthIn January, prior to the major correction of bitcoin, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz stated that the organization is willing to integrate a cryptocurrency in the future if it is retailer friendly and it is able to handle a certain capacity of transactions that is sufficient for large-scale conglomerates.During a conference call, Schultz stated that he personally does not believe bitcoin would be the global currency that will be adopted by retailers, but a cryptocurrency could be used in the future by retailers.â€œI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction,â€ù said Schultz.As Visa executive and Bitcoin Foundation co-founder Jon Matonis previously emphasized, the legitimacy of bitcoin as a global currency could continue to increase as major banks like Goldman Sachs and retailers like Newegg continue to adopt bitcoin as a payment method and a currency.Currently, the extreme volatility of the market makes it dififcult for retailers to fully adopt cryptocurrencies as a payment method. But, as the market grows and matures with public investment vehicles and more regulated investment channels, bitcoin could evolve into a global digital currency that is widely adopted by retailers.â€œI think itâ€™s fabulous that theyâ€™re getting into it because it brings in new liquidity. Theyâ€™re going to develop futures markets, options markets, I even think youâ€™re going to start to see interest rate markets around bitcoin. Weâ€™re used to hearing things about Libor, the index for bitcoin interest rates is Bibor,â€ù Matonis noted, emphasizing that the emergence of bitcoin-based investment vehicles would lead to overall improvement in liquidity and stability.Featured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/retailer-adoption-of-bitcoin-is-growing-in-the-us-and-canada-despite-price-fall/

"The Story of Alphacatâ€™s Founder, Dr. Bin Li",1523116298,"AdvertisementThis is a paid-for submitted press release. CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.It takes a special kind of person to create something uniquely revolutionary. Alphacatâ€™s founder Dr. Bin Li is definitely that.To see how he got to where he is today, letâ€™s take a look at the making of the man, from Liâ€™s early education right up until he created Alphacat.Notably gifted from an early age, Li was accepted into the prestigious China University of Science and Technology at just 16 years of age.While completing his studies, he caught the eye of Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, a Chinese American physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics. Dr. Lee recognized Liâ€™s potential and decided to sponsor his further education overseas.The young prodigy left for the United States and enrolled at New York University and in 1992, where he gained a Ph.D.Following the completion of his postdoctoral research at the highly regarded NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Dr. Bin Li was employed by investment bank Merrill Lynch. This marked the beginning of a successful career on Wall Street.Li quickly rose through the ranks of Merrill Lynch to become Vice President. Not content to rest on his laurels, Li also assumed the position of Director of Global Quantitative Trading Strategies Group.Li and five others formed the board of the of UBS North Americaâ€™s Executive Committee. In 2001, Li and his fellow board members created AASTOCKS.com, a popular financial web portal that grew to become the largest of its kind in Hong Kong.Li has also served as Chairman of Westport Financial LLC, the Chief Operating Officer of Ping Capital, the CIO of Yellow River Fund, and was the Senior Fund Manager at famous hedge fund Paloma Partners.But as successful as was in business, Li yearned for something more. He wanted to give everyday people the opportunity to discover the vast opportunities of investment, both within China and internationally.This ambition led to the creation of Alphacat. The AI cryptocurrency trading platform is revolutionary because it will allow everybody â€“ not just the ultra-wealthy â€“ to take advantage of its world-class trading robots.Li built a team of over 30 individuals with expertise in the fields of artificial intelligence, finance technology, machine learning, and blockchain technology.Since its inception, Alphacat has been reinventing the dynamics of cryptocurrency trading, giving ordinary traders the tools to make sound investments in an emerging market.Perhaps the best explanation of what Alphacat is all about comes from Bin Li, himself: â€œThe vision of Alphacat is to make quality investment advice more accessible for the average person by simplifying the whole cryptocurrency exchange process through a smart interplay of AI-driven robot advisors and analysis of big data to give a market prediction accuracy of 60% and aboveâ€ù.It takes an ambitious person to follow an ambitious dream and in Bin Li, Alphacat has just that. 2018 promises to be an exciting year for the project and with some big announcements coming soon, this is definitely one to watch.Media ContactTwitter: https://twitter.com/Alphacat_ioFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Alphacat.ioMediumï__https://medium.com/@AlphacatglobalTelegram ï__https://t.me/alphacatglobalWebsiteï__www.alphacat.io  Emailï__public@alphacat.io",1,https://www.ccn.com/the-story-of-alphacats-founder-dr-bin-li/

This forum gathered numerous entrepreneurs and leaders from blockchain and game industry, where they deeply communicated about subjects as the overturn that blockchain brings for traditional game industry, the development tendency for blockchain games, as well as rebuilding the credit value of game industry by blockchain. In view of this, some of them have given speeches to share their opinions, such as Eric Sun, CEO & Founder of BIT.GAME, and Owen Tao, CEO of Matrix AI Network, etc.In 2017, the actual sales revenue of game market exceeded 200 billion RMB in China. According to the latest analyst of Digi-Capital, the global hardware and software revenue within game industry has increased around $165 and $170 billion in 2018 as the market scale keeps expanding . While the fading dividend of population, IP and traffic have also brought a bottleneck for the future of game industry.While Blockchainâ€™s show-up may bring some new directions for all walks of life to the next level of development. The innovative decentralizing and distributed ledger technology makes it upgrade from information internet to value internet. As the first blockchain game CryptoKitties growing more and more popular, blockchain games seem to be another new engine of economic growth besides in financial industry, and itâ€™s also supposed to be the Ace in game industry, thus open a new gate for global game industry.  During the forum, blockchain experts not only introduced the development situation of blockchain,  but also the latest results and innovative ideas in building the game platforms. Eric Sun, as a professional game producer and the founder of BIT.GAME, delivered his speech in the forum regarding some main topics that game publishers care the most. He said, for a long time, CPs (Content Providers) as the craftsmen of game industry have always been on the low end of the value chain. For them, the combination of blockchain and game would be a rare but perfect chance, since this unique technology may bring challenges to all business.Based on the long-term study for game industry, BIT.GAME has produced a detailed research report on blockchain games, and brought up quite a few instructive point of views for the aspects of blockchain game developing as well as the development of underlying technology for blockchain.According to report, There are three stages before blockchain games go fully and widely spread: data mapping, data on chain and logic on chain. â€œNow it only supports to establish 1:1 mapping relationship between game data and token, and the total number of game coins is fixed. For the next stage, all the game data is supposed to be on chain and decentralized, which needs the support from the underlying logic and it still takes some time to achieve. The third stage is to popularize the smart contract, this allows all the players to have the access of checking the logic on chain, and activate the smart contract by simply playing the gamesâ€ù, Eric as the CEO and Founder of BIT.GAME said.Eric also mentioned that, there are two main problems for traditional game publishers to transfer into blockchain games, one is the high technique barrier, since itâ€™s quite difficult for game companies to find too many blockchain talents to proceed the projects; the other is the difficulty of monetizing the value, since the present exchanges are always set up with higher barriers, there is averagely superficial understanding of blockchain among game players, so there may lack of the mutual value on this game soil.In response to these issues, BIT.GAME produces a complete set of blockchain game solution with the help of its blockchain technology. Besides, BIT.GAME builds the first global blockchain game exchange, and also provides with a blockchain game incubation platform. All of these constitute the whole structure of BIT.GAME business.In the aspect of technology, BIT.GAME provides a set of development kits for traditional game developers in connection with public blockchain such as Ethereum, ABitChain, QTUM, Matrix AI Network etc, thus the games would be in line with BIT.GAME Exchange. Meanwhile, BIT.GAME devotes itself to forming the biggest assets transaction platform for global blockchain games, which allows players to do transactions through tokens. BIT.GAME also provides an incubation platform for blockchain games and offers with technical support and financial investment.â€œIt will only take as soon as 2 years to fully spread the blockchain technology to the whole world and make into full use.â€ù said Eric when talking about the future of blockchain games.During the forum, there was also a league called GBGU (as Global Blockchain Game Union) announcing established, and held ceremony in the forum. GBGU consists of BIT.GAME, ForGame, TrustNote, ABitChain, Matrix AI Network etc. GBGU aims to unite all the resources and provide technical support and platform service jointly, thus to proceed the development of blockchain and game industries, as well as to infill the new energy for the stable growth of game industry.For More information:Official Website: https://bit.gameE-mail: sns@bit.gameFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BitGameENTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitGameENTelegram: https://t.me/BIT_GAME_PROJECTGithub: https://github.com/BitGameEN",1,https://www.ccn.com/blockchain-game-becomes-the-main-topic-in-global-blockchain-summit/

The Datareum token pre-sale begins April 28th, 2018.April 3rd, 2018, London, UK â€“ In the information age, data is one of the most valuable resources on the planet; personal user data is being sold in enormous volumes for enormous profits and often, without the consumerâ€™s consent or knowledge. Itâ€™s an invasive and archaic and invasive practice â€“ the data brokering industry leverages consumer data as an economic asset. Our behaviours, interests, preferences, age, location and gender are being monetized with absolutely no return for the consumer.Big MoneyAt present, large international organizations and companies are benefiting from the $200 Billion worth of sophisticated data sets available; the industry is dominated by huge companies like Equifax who own the data sets of 800 Million individuals worldwide, those data sets brought in $3.16 Billion for Equifax in 2016 alone.Other larger companies such as Facebook and Google make billions more from the complex data sets gathered from our online habits; most of this data is walled off and sealed away, out of the reach of individuals and researchers who could benefit significantly from the data beyond that of just monetary value. Datareum is positioning itself to be a disruptive force in this once sided market and are bringing power to consumers through a decentralized data marketplace.Datareum is creating an opportunity for society to take control of their data and sell it or give it way; through a fair and transparent data marketplace, data providers are incentivised to produce and provide high-quality data. Data purchasers on the other hand now have access to data, for lower costs thanks to complete elimination of intermediaries.Key Components of DatareumThe Datareum platform is made up of a few key components: for starters, Requesters are those who request of purchase data, and they may commission a survey directly or purchase survey results that have already been resold on the data marketplace. Providers are those who give away data for free or sell it, though they may previously be requesters who are providing data through resale.The Data Marketplace is where smart contracts determine the legitimacy of data entered on to the platform, and it also confirms whether or not the data is delivered of rejected and if so it completes the exchange or payment between the two parties. The DataVault is a secure location in which data providers can enter all their basic information and therefore can be monetized according to the userâ€™s preference.DTN Token WhitelistOnly people who have successfully passed KYC will be able to contribute to the token sale on April 28th, 2018. If you are not KYC approved please do not attempt to participate or send funds anywhere related to the Datareum token sale.Where to access â€” https://tokensale.datareum.net/registerDTN Token Pre-SaleThe final key component is the native token of the Datareum platform, DTN, which is used for all transactions on the platform. The pre-sale for DTN will begin April 28th, 2018, participants will be able to make minimum contributions of 1 ETH which lands them a 10% bonus, and if they make contributions of 5 ETH or higher, they will receive a 20% Bonus.Visit the Datareum Official Site â€“  https://www.datareum.net/Check out the Whitepaper â€“ https://datareum.net/whitepaper.pdfBitcoinTalk (Ann) â€“ https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3189049Chat on Telegram (25k members and growing) â€“ https://t.me/datareumFollow on Twitter â€“ https://twitter.com/datareumFollow on Facebook â€“ https://www.facebook.com/datareumdtnRead the Medium â€“ https://medium.com/datareumMedia ContactContact Name: Jorge PerezContact Email: jorgeperez@datareum.netDatareum is the source owner of this content.

Arizonaâ€™s Corporate Blockchain Bill Becomes Law,1523114083,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Arizona just advanced its ranking among blockchain-friendly states, bringing corporations one step closer to submitting all of their data on distributed ledger technology.Governor Doug Ducey has signed House Bill 2603, or the Corporations/Blockchain Technology bill, as an amendment to the Arizona Revised Statutes, which already supports â€œsignatures and records secured through blockchain technology and smart contracts.â€ù With the amendment, data thatâ€™s stored and shared by corporations on the blockchain also becomes valid.Arizonaâ€™s blockchain bill was first introduced to the House in February and passed the State Legislature in a matter of weeks. HB 2603 received strong support from lawmakers, including unanimous support from the Senate and only a handful of â€œnayâ€ù votes in the House. The bill was transmitted to Governor Duceyâ€™s desk in late March, where he signed it into law on April 3.â€œThe goal is to allow in a couple years for corporations to submit their records on a blockchain,â€ù Representative Jeff Weninger, the sponsor of the bill and a champion for blockchain innovation in the state, told a local news publication.Last year at about this time, Rep. Weninger introduced the law that recognized blockchain-fueled signatures and smart contracts as valid, which really set in motion the innovation that would follow from policymakers looking to catapult their state as a hotbed for innovation.Another Weninger bill is the Running Nodes/Blockchain/Regulation Prohibition act, which would block cities from preventing an individual â€œfrom running a node on blockchain technology in a residence,â€ù or cryptocurrency mining. Rather, he believes itâ€™s a decision that should be made at the state level.Meanwhile, northwest of Arizona in Washington, the pendulum is swinging to the other side, where local policymakers have placed a moratorium on bitcoin mining applications for the time being.Arizona and FintechThe Southwestern state has taken a leadership position with blockchain, and they have more innovation ahead. Rep. Weninger is co-sponsoring a bill to allow tax payments in bitcoin. The tax bill is taking a bit longer to make its way through the Legislature, but it could be a model for other states to adopt if it passes.The state is looking to fintech more broadly to bolster the economy, as evidenced by the fintech regulatory sandbox that became a reality last month. It gives entrepreneurs the ability to come to the state and focus on testing their products without the cumbersome legal regulatory fees and expenses that typically accompany innovation.Featured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/arizonas-corporate-blockchain-bill-becomes-law/

The idea of selling these tokens to merchants will be solely dependent on the situation. Whenever customers make purchases at participating merchants, the tokens will end up in the hands of customers. The customers will make the decisions on whether to trade it or redeem it. The token can be properly used after the successful launching of the platform.Visit the Website: https://dynatiq.comRead the Whitepaper: https://dynatiq.com/whitepaper.pdfJoin on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Dynatiq-346748242496542/Follow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dynatiqLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdaluzza/Media Contact: Dynatiq FounderName: Abd al UzzaLocation: Dubai, United Arab EmiratesEmail: info@dynatiq.comDynatiq is the source of this content.

SEC Chair: Not All ICOs Are Frauds,1523113236,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said contrary to speculation, the SEC does not believe that all initial coin offerings are fraudulent.â€œAbsolutely not,â€ù Clayton said when asked if the SECâ€™s recent crackdowns on ICOs signals such a stance. Clayton made the remarks during a speech on â€œCryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offeringsâ€ù at Princeton University on April 5.Clayton said stamping out fraud in the crypto market is critical to protect consumers. He also said increased regulatory scrutiny will actually benefit the industry by ridding it of fraudsters and scam artists who give the entire space a bad name.And driving out bad actors early on will ensure that the government wonâ€™t eventually adopt such a hard-line stance that it will effectively choke off the budding industry, Clayton reasoned.SEC chairman Jay Clayton. (C-Span)  â€œIs the approach taken in Washington by the SEC adversely affecting distributed ledger technology in other areas? My hope is that itâ€™s actually helping, because this technology is being used for fraud,â€ù Clayton said. â€œAnd to the extent that itâ€™s being used for fraud, history shows that government comes down harshly on that technology later.â€ùHe added: â€œIf we donâ€™t stop the fraudsters, there is a serious risk that the regulatory pendulum â€“ the regulatory actions â€“ will be so severe that they will restrict the capacity of this new security.â€ùIn February 2018, Clayton signaled that his agency would investigate cryptocurrencies when he testified before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. At the time, he said: â€œI believe every ICO Iâ€™ve seen is a security.â€ùWeeks later, the SEC targeted ICOs by issuing â€œdozens of subpoenasâ€ù to crypto-related tech companies and advisors to investigate how ICOs are structured.$32 Million ICO Halted For FraudOn April 2, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas, the co-founders of Centra Tech.Sharma and Farkas are accused of raising $32 million by selling â€œunregistered securitiesâ€ù during the Centra ICO, which was promoted by boxing champ Floyd Mayweather and record producer DJ Khaled.Meanwhile, the SEC is now considering two bitcoin exchange-traded funds â€” the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF â€” for listing on the NYSE Arca, the first all-electronic exchange in the United States, according to public documents.Cboe President Urged SEC To Allow Crypto ETFsThe SEC consideration of bitcoin ETFs comes shortly after Cboe president Chris Concannon urged the agency to allow crypto ETFs.In a March 23 letter to the SEC, Concannon dismissed criticism that virtual currencies are too illiquid and volatile to be treated like other established commodities.â€œBecause of its innovative features as a digital asset, bitcoin has gained wide acceptance as a secure means of exchange in the commercial marketplace and has generated significant interest among investors,â€ù Concannon wrote.Cboe president Chris Concannon to SEC: Give bitcoin a chance. (YouTube)Concannon also said there is enough â€œreliable price informationâ€ù from the bitcoin futures market on Cboe Futures Exchange and CME that should ease regulatory worries about its opaqueness as an investment vehicle.â€œThere is real-time trade data available 24 hours a day from a number of different trading platforms around the world, with a collective volume in the billions of dollars daily,â€ù Concannon said. â€œBetween these various potential pricing sources, there is more than sufficient information for cryptocurrency ETPs to create reliable and robust valuation methodologies for bitcoin and potentially for other cryptocurrencies.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/sec-chair-not-all-icos-are-frauds/

A strategic plan of international expansion. BigBitcoin will cover the largest markets in the Asian region to lay a solid foundation for the token.05 April 2018. China: In modern world, the status of global economy based on Asia, while in the blockchain area, the largest mining industry chain is in China. The volume of digital assets of the three countries (China, Japan and South Korea) occupies more than half of digital assets in the world.In this case, BBC first launched on the six international digital asset trading platforms, giving priority to the layout of Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other Asian economies, which is closely related to the reason mentioned above.It is undeniable that the dividend of the rapid development of Chinese economy is firstly shared by the surrounding Asian countries, which benefit from the geography factor. The development of the economy means the increase of leisure funds in the hands of people and the increase of their desire for investment. The prospect of block chainâ€™s development and the investment value of the digital assets drive this region to be the focus.BBC came into being from BTC and took the lead in this trend. The most concentrated volume of business in Asia and North America laid the foundation for subsequent global circulation and decentralization operation. BBC dares to have such ambition is because of its own strength.After the Bitcoin ForkBigBitcoin has completed the Bitcoin fork on 13th February, with the block size of 16M and the block time of 2.5 minutes. It completed the docking of Bitpie and Bitgo wallets, and cooperated with several media and projects to successfully finish the first round of publicity and hold the candy activity.According to the analysis of BBC bifurcation block data, there are 60% of BTC users receiving BBC, while there are more than 10 million BTC users around the world. BBC has acquired a large number of users from the BTC community by means of a bifurcated distribution.In addition, cooperation between BBC foundation and teams such as ETChain community, Bitpie community, Cloud chain community, Italy and other European and American teams are expected to add 1 million cash users to BBC community in March. In order to support the follow-up development and the maintenance of related community, BBC management big bitcoin foundation has invested mining machines to start mining.BBC from mining will be used to encourage the community, to support new excellent project on the main network, and to help the publicity of outstanding project by project candies.The block size of BBC16M is 16 times more than that of BTC 1M, and the block time (2.5 minutes) is 4 times more than that of BTC (10 minutes). At the same time, BBC also supports segregated witness, lightning network and graphene technology. For mass transactions and high concurrency, it can provide reliable and effective technical support for speed and data throughput capability.In addition, the BBC team also pioneered the chain matrix model. When dealing with high concurrent transactions, the BBC main chain will automatically create chain matrixes that are local parallel chains, and each of them inherits the characteristics of the BBC main chain. The local parallel chain can even reach the confirmation speed of millisecond, which improves the performance of the BBC main chain at multiples. Therefore the payment speed can reach the level in Taobao Double eleven, which is a unique precedent in other BTC bifurcations.Upgrades All RoundThere are two adjustments in the mining model: one is to adjust the difficulty of the proof of workload (PoW), which can enable the miners to transfer freely from the traditional BTC to the BBC; the other is to add Equihash algorithm on the basis of the sha256 algorithm so as to disperse the mining patterns by the use of GPU. These two methods can not only improve the efficiency of BBC mining, but also ensure the fairness.Visit the Website: http://bigbitcoins.orgRead the Whitepaper: http://bigbitcoins.org/files/BigBitcoin-BBC-WhitePaper.pdfChat on Telegram: https://t.me/bbcgroupsMedia ContactName: Andrew MasoLocation: BeijingEmail: Media@bigbitcoins.orgBigBitcoin is the source of this content.

CCN does not endorse, nor is responsible for any material included below and isnâ€™t responsible for any damages or losses connected with any products or services mentioned in the press release.

The swiss-based company use military grade AI tech and telematics to provide safe drivers with a decentralized  app that accepts cryptocurrency payments for their car insurance.April 4th, 2018, Zug, Switzerland â€“ Swiss-based blockchain startup kasko2go uses military grade AI technologies, advanced telematics and a  experienced team of professionals to offer new low-cost driving insurance.

Billionaire Mark Cuban Hates Bitcoin and Gold Equally: â€˜Iâ€™d Buy a Pet Rock Firstâ€™,1523110037,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Tech billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, hates both gold and bitcoin, saying theyâ€™re not viable alternatives to currency.â€œI hate gold. Gold is a religion,â€ù Cuban told Kitco (video below). â€œI do not see gold as an alternative to currency. Not at all. Letâ€™s put it this way: I donâ€™t see people in Puerto Rico carrying around big bags of gold to try to save things.â€ùCuban said both gold and bitcoin derive their values from supply and demand, but have no inherent value. He said â€œhateâ€ù is not strong enough a word to capture his antipathy for gold.â€œHate with extreme prejudice, with an ounce of hot sauceâ€ù is how the billionaire star of â€œShark Tankâ€ù says he feels about gold, and by extension, bitcoin.â€œI see gold and bitcoin as being the same thing,â€ù he said. â€œTheyâ€™re book collectibles. Their value is based off of supply and demandâ€_Iâ€™d sooner buy a pet rock.â€ùCuban added: â€œThe good news about bitcoin is that thereâ€™s a finite supply thatâ€™ll ever be created, and the bad news about gold is that theyâ€™ll keep mining more.â€ùFans Can Buy Mavs Tickets With BitcoinDespite Mark Cubanâ€™s bearish stance on bitcoin, he will allow fans to use bitcoin to pay for tickets to Dallas Mavericks games starting next season.Cuban made the revelation on Twitter in January 2018 in response to a fan who asked: â€œMark, when will I be able to purchase Mavs tickets with bitcoin?â€ù He replied: â€œNext season.â€ùâ€œWe will be adding a crypto payment ability,â€ù Cuban said (via CNBC). â€œWe will accept BTC, ETH, possibly some other currencies. [Thatâ€™s] to be determined.â€ùMark Cubanâœ”@mcubanReplying to @iamabitcornNext season.3:18 AM - Jan 16, 2018811349 people are talking about thisTwitter Ads info and privacyInterestingly, Cuban â€” whose net worth reportedly tops $3.7 billion â€” owns bitcoin and has invested in the cryptocurrency industry, but warned fans about throwing their money behind speculative investments such as crypto.Cuban has long been skeptical of bitcoin because of its erratic price swings based seemingly on nothing. â€œItâ€™s still very much a gamble,â€ù he told Money. â€œIt could go to $15,000 or zero, and maybe both on the same day.â€ùCuban is right. Bitcoin prices are prone to wild, unexpected swings. After scoring an all-time high of $19,000 in December 2017, BTC prices have tanked below $7,000 this week. But keep in mind that BTC hovered at just $1,000 in January 2017.Only Invest in BTC If You Can Handle Losing It AllFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said bitcoin prices crashed recently because U.S. investors were rapidly selling off their crypto holdings to avoid paying capital-gains taxes.But Lee, a noted bitcoin bull, projects BTC will rise again after Tax Day passes on April 17. Is that a given? As with anything crypto, the answer is: Nope, weâ€™ll have to wait and see.Cuban said you should invest in virtual currencies only if you can handle losing all the money.â€œIf youâ€™re a true adventurer and you really want to throw the Hail Mary, you might take 10% and put it in bitcoin or ethereum,â€ù he said. â€œBut if you do that, youâ€™ve got to pretend youâ€™ve already lost your money.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/billionaire-mark-cuban-hates-bitcoin-and-gold-equally-id-buy-a-pet-rock-first/
Wall Street Banker Quits to Advise ICO Startups â€“ Report,1523107077,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Brian Wirtz must have been a fish out of water at Credit Suisse Group AG. The investment banker for the bankâ€™s tech, media and telecom group was more interested in evangelizing cryptocurrencies than he was traditional deals, and most likely that made him the odd man out at a firm as traditional as Credit Suisse.Wirtz is leaving the Swiss bank where he was employed for nearly five years to start his own venture advising ICO companies with a focus on those issuing security tokens, according to Bloomberg.According to his LinkedIn profile, Wirtz in his role at Credit Suisse was an â€œinvestment banker focused on helping crypto core teams achieve their strategic missions.â€ù Wirtz previously described himself as the head of blockchain advisory at the bank, which should serve him well when advising ICO startups. He further calls himself a â€œdirector blockchain, cryptoasset, investment banking,â€ù but the bank couldnâ€™t contain his ambitions.Hereâ€™s what you should know about Wirtz â€“Heâ€™s been engaged with bitcoin since 2012He â€œbrought it with him to Credit Suisse in 2013â€ùHe fought for six months  to sign a bitcoin mining company at the bankHis move to advise ICO startups is a boon for the industry. Heâ€™s previously explored themes such as where the industry is in the cycle as compared to the rise of the internet as well as how companies should be investing in blockchain technology.Security-Token ICOsAs far as Wall Street banks go, Credit Suisse is on the outskirts of the nascent crypto market, having hosted cryptocurrency conferences for institutional investors in major US cities that inspired hundreds of bitcoin enthusiasts. Even Wirtz once said that Credit Suisse â€œwas leading the charge among bulge brackets for cryptocurrencies.â€ùBut Wirtz is setting out for green pastures, with plans to launch a startup seemingly to advise security-token ICOs, which gives more regulatory heft to the deals versus utility tokens.Itâ€™s a step that should bolster confidence among ICO issuers, as a banker who has been engaged with major tech deals is lending his experience to new coin issuance, where regulators have been circling amid a Wild West environment. Heâ€™s accustomed to working with regulated securities and therefore will provide a certain amount of compliance that quite frankly the market probably needs.Wirtz gave Credit Suisse the opportunity to become more engaged with cryptocurrency-fueled deals, according to the report. But for all of his good intentions, Wirtz couldnâ€™t accomplish all he wanted within the confines of a major investment bank and a CEO, Tidjane Thiam, who is still apprehensive about cryptocurrencies. Credit Suisse is investing in blockchain, but so is JPMorgan, and the league tables have yet to identify the rankings among cryptocurrency deals.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/wall-street-banker-quits-to-advise-ico-startups-report/
"Bitcoin Price Increases by 4%, Eyes Move to $7,000 as Market Gains $19 Billion",1523099150,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has gained $19 billion, from $248 billion to $257 billion, as major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and Ethereum recovered from their recent losses, as bitcoin price rose 4%.Bitcoinâ€™s RiseOn April 6, the bitcoin price fell from $7,000 to $6,500. Traders were anticipating a potential drop to the yearly bottom at $6,000, as bitcoin price remained at the $6,000 mark for several hours before rebounding to $6,600. If the bitcoin price had not rebounded from that level and sustained the $6,500 mark, the price of bitcoin could have dropped to the $6,000 mark.However, as time passed, bitcoin started to demonstrate some buy volumes, and it picked up momentum on April 7. Eventually, within a 24-hour span, the bitcoin price increased from $6,500 to $6,950.The 15-minute candle chart of bitcoin on April 6 evidently showed the end of its corrective rally from $6,600 to $7,500, which could have been key to bitcoinâ€™s short-term recovery towards the $8,000 region. In the upcoming days, bitcoin could eye the $8,000 region if it can rise back again to $7,500 and test the $7,800 level.Throughout today, bitcoin has shown some signs of recovery, and if this rally takes bitcoin to the $7,000 region, it is likely that bitcoin could eye the $7,500 mark, as it had earlier this week.Generally, the market has also become optimistic towards the entrance of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. In December, investors expected a wave of retail traders to enter the bitcoin sector through the bitcoin futures market. But, volumes on the bitcoin futures market have been virtually non-existent, and the demand from institutional investors from the west has been a disappointment.This week, George Soros and Soros Fund, a fund founded by the legendary $8 billion investor, announced that it is preparing to trade cryptocurrencies, as Bloomberg reported. Over the past three months, several large hedge funds like Fortress have exited the space. If new capital comes into the market in an extremely volatile period like this, it could help bitcoin to recover from its previous losses.â€œAdam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade virtual coins in the last few months, though he has yet to make a wager, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman declined to comment,â€ù read Bloombergâ€™s report.OntologySince April 4, Ontology has been the best performing alternative cryptocurrency against bitcoin. WIthin a three day span, the value of Ontology has nearly doubled against bitcoin on Binance, the worldâ€™s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Several altcoins such as ICON have also performed well against bitcoin, leading to excitement within the cryptocurrency space.Still, although several altcoins have outperformed bitcoin in the past few days, it is uncertain whether the altcoin season will arrive in the short-term.

Central Bank Digital Currency Could Go Live This Year: R3 Research Director,1523095832,"AdvertisementJoin our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.A form of central bank issued digital currency (CBDC) could go live this year, according to Antony Lewis, R3 director of research, cash and CBDC strategy, speaking on panel of experts at the Deconomy conference this week at the Walkerhill Hotel in South Korea.All panelists speaking on â€œIndustry Evolution Through Distributed Ledgerâ€ù were hopeful that CBDC will be launched for select financial institutions.Lewis believes that blockchain technology will be used by select financial institutions.Central Banks Voice Supportâ€œWe have had conversations with central banks who have mandates to fix certain payment problems, and one solution they look to is a blockchain type of platform,â€ù Lewis said, according to a report posted by Korea Coin on YouTube.Lewis said this does not mean consumers will have a new payment choice that functions like bitcoin or Ether. Instead, Lewis predicted that only select financial institutions would use such a cryptocurrency to start.Such a system would likely even be used in situations such as disaster recovery, he said.â€œDonâ€™t make your secondary (decentralized) system look like your primary (centralized) system,â€ù Lewis said. Otherwise, if a primary system goes down in an attack, the attackers would only need to play the same trick.â€œThen itâ€™s not resilience, itâ€™s just another IP address to attack,â€ù he said.Application To Commercial BankingPanelist Stanley Yong, global CBDC lead at IBM and a former CBDC researcher at Singaporeâ€™s central bank, agreed that a blockchain system will eventually be best applied to commercial banking and was hesitant about its application to consumers.â€œIf it issues cryptocurrency to millions and billions of citizens, it will have to hold all these individual accounts, which inherently increases the market and credit risks,â€ù Yong said.Also read: R3, 22 member banks develop instant cross-border payments platformCentral Banks Have Specific RolePanelist Ian Grigg, a financial cryptographer, said it might not even be the fundamental role of central banks to issue a retail CBDC.The Bank of England, for example, supports the deposit of commercial banks, Grigg said. Hence, directly issuing a cryptocurrency to the public could undermine existing commercial banksâ€™ deposit base, ultimately impacting the loan market, he said.The Bank of International Settlements previously stated that a CBDC could give rise to â€œhigher instability of commercial bank deposit funding.â€ùThe panelists were hopeful that blockchains will replace existing banking technology.Yong went as far as to state such systems are â€œdue for retirement.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.Follow us on Telegram.Advertisement",1,https://www.ccn.com/cbdc-could-go-live-this-year-r3-research-director-claims/
Cybersecurity Report: Cryptojacking Remains an Acute Threat in 2018,1523573337,"Cybercrime ran rampant last year, and the cryptocurrency market was no exception, as evidenced by hacks involving bitcoin ransoms and the pervasive use of cryptojacking. Cryptojacking involves using someoneâ€™s CPUs to secretly mine cryptocurrency without that personâ€™s permission. And according to a report by the UKâ€™s National Crime Agency (NCA) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) entitled The Cyber Threat to UK Business, â€œcryptojacking will likely become a regular source of revenue for website owners.â€ùThe price for a cyberattack is high, both reputationally and financially. And while corporations are ramping up their cybersecurity defenses, the threat of a security breach has not abated. If anything itâ€™s intensified with the rise of cloud technology where sensitive data is stored and also cryptocurrency mining, where cybercriminals in 2017 rode the wave of the rise in the cryptocurrency prices.The report reveals that the perpetrators of cryptojacking are two-pronged, stemming both from hackers and website owners who â€œused the processing power of visitorsâ€™ CPUs to mine cryptocurrency for their own financial gain.â€ù For example, earlier this year a US business decided it was okay to user its visitorsâ€™ CPUs to mine Monero if that visitor used an ad-blocker. The website, however, informed its visitors of the plan in order to â€œrecoup lost ad revenue.â€ùCryptojacking remains a security threat as long as the interest surrounding cryptocurrencies remains â€œstrong,â€ù the report suggests.Cryptojacking via malware is not new to the scene and has been used by cybercriminals to secretly mine bitcoin or other digital coins for years. But for the 2018-2019 period, a â€œnewer technique of mining cryptocurrencyâ€ù has emerged that â€œexploits visitors to a website,â€ù and this has become the key threat, the report indicates.For instance, in February 2018 alone, thousands of websites globally and hundreds in the UK â€œsecretly mined cryptocurrency through a compromised screen-reading plugin for blind and partially sighted people.â€ù Meanwhile, in December 2017, when the bitcoin price reached its height and miners were generating profits hand over fist, more than half of businesses around the world â€œwere impacted by cryptominers,â€ù the report reveals.The bad news is that the problem isnâ€™t going away any time soon â€“â€œPopular websites are likely to continue to be targets for compromise, serving cryptomining malware to visitors, and software is available that, when run in a webpage, uses the visiting computerâ€™s spare computer processing power to mine the digital currency Monero.â€ù â€” NCA reportBut if you notice a slowdown in your computerâ€™s performance or a sudden jump in usage, these are signals that your CPUs or GPUs may have been invaded by cryptojackers. The report suggests using an ad-blocker or antivirus software thatâ€™s designed to detect the nefarious cryptojacking activity.Hereâ€™s an illustration of what victims of the WannaCry ransomware faced on their computers last year, with the hackers demanding a payment in â€œbitcoin onlyâ€ù to recover the lost files.A South Korean web-hosting company paid the BTC ransom, which was worth USD 1 million. Meanwhile, DDoS attacks grew more pervasive in 2017, with the number of instances having risen more than 90% in September 2017 versus January of last year. As CCN previously reported, however, hackers are turned off by the volatility in the bitcoin because of the price instability and therefore shifted to fiat money-denominated ransoms instead.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/cybersecurity-report-cryptojacking-remains-an-acute-threat-in-2018/
Russian Police Crackdown on Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining Farm,1523569719,"Police in Russia have developed a case against two organizers of a cryptocurrency mining farm in Orenburg, according to Irina Volk of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation, RIA56, a Russian news source, reported.More than 6,000 pieces of computer equipment were discovered at the former plant of the RTI which police believe was a mining farm. Police had installed agents at the site. The bitcoin farm used 8 million kilowatts per hour without taking into account power consumption.Police found equipment connected to the power grid, as well as power supply cables leading to a nearby substation.The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Orenburg region identified suspects involved in the crime, Volk said. They included two company executives working in the factory. The criminal case is based on property damage.A mining farm was reported in early March, but police did not comment on it at the time. Engineers suspected large-scale theft of electricity and alerted law enforcement, who discovered powerful computer equipment they suspected was used for cryptocurrency mining.Police have not assessed the scale and profitability of the farm or the amount of damage caused.Also read: Russian engineers caught using state supercomputer to mine bitcoinsIn March, sources claimed a mining workshop in Orenburg was the largest in the Volga Federal District.

"Future Gains! Bitcoin Has Bottomed Out, Says Pantera Capital in a Bold Call",1523564812,"Nowâ€™s the time to get long bitcoin, a leading cryptocurrency hedge fund says. Not only is bitcoin out of the doldrums, but itâ€™s onward and upward from here.This according to Pantera Capital Management, a cryptocurrency hedge fund with $800 million-plus in assets under management, in a letter to investors cited on Bloomberg.â€œFor those who are new to Pantera who might think a fund manager like Pantera would always be saying â€˜Todayâ€™s a great day to get long. I rarely have such strong conviction on timing. A wall of institutional money will drive the markets much higher,â€ù according to Panteraâ€™s Dan Morehead and Joey Krug in the note.Just look at their track record. Pantera, which first gained exposure to bitcoin in 2014, has only made a trio of buy calls and a single recommendation in the past seven years, as per their note. So theyâ€™re not reckless about making these calls in the least. The latest call of a bottom comes on the heels of bitcoin breaching its pivotal 200-day moving average, which reflects the long-term trend.A rising tide lifts all boats, and the other cryptocurrencies are trading in the green as well. The news couldnâ€™t come too soon after the bitcoin price had been slipping and sliding since a month ago. If Panteraâ€™s right, the storm clouds have cleared and the sun is about to shine on bitcoin investors.Every bitcoin investor has been wondering what the bottom is during this bear market of 2018, and Pantera said the floor was $6,500. Now that itâ€™s crossed the psychologically important 200-day moving average, and while every day may not be an up day, expect trading above that level for most of the coming year. Not only that, but itâ€™s only a matter of time before bitcoin beats last yearâ€™s record price of nearly $20,000.Nobody is happier to hear that the worst is over for bitcoin than Pantera, which through year-end 2017 had generated returns of some 25,000% since the fundâ€™s inception. But Pantera like many funds invested in cryptocurrencies has struggled with the bear market, especially in March.The value of its Digital Asset Fund was nearly halved last month when it lost 45.7% of its value. It was the volatility in the bitcoin price that rocked the fund, â€œwhich was the worst in [their] modelâ€™s 27-month history,â€ù as per Panteraâ€™s Krug cited in last monthâ€™s investor letter.Krug is no doubt breathing a sigh of relief as all of the crypto community can do now that this technically important level has been achieved.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/pantera-capital-bitcoin-has-bottomed-out/
"XRP â€˜100 Percent Not a Security,â€™ Ripple Claims",1523560963,"Fintech startup Ripple is pushing back against claims that its cryptocurrency, XRP, is a security under US regulations.The XRP token â€” which functions as the native currency of the San Francisco-based companyâ€™s public Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL) and the foundation for several of the firmâ€™s blockchain products â€” is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of more than $22 billion.Some allege that because Ripple distributes XRP by selling the coins â€” and most buyers purchase them as investments â€” it is subject to the same securities regulations that govern stocks, bonds, and even many initial coin offering (ICO) tokens.If true, this could have serious legal ramifications, both for Ripple and the cryptocurrency exchanges that list it for trading.Ripple, though, argues that those claims are unfounded.â€œWe absolutely are not a security. We donâ€™t meet the standards for what a security is based on the history of court law,â€ù Rippleâ€™s chief market strategist, Cory Johnson, said during an interview with CNBC.The discussion over whether XRP is a security resurfaces at semi-regular intervals, but the current debate stems from comments made by Coinbase President and COO Asiff Hirji in a recent appearance what may as well be renamed the â€œCryptocurrency News and Bitcoin Channel.â€ùToward the end of the interview, Hirji said that the exchange and brokerage giant is already listing every cryptocurrency for which it believes there is regulatory certainty. At present, the company lists four cryptocurrencies â€” and XRP is not one of them.Johnson, responding to this and alluding to recent reports that Ripple had attempted to bribe Coinbase with incentives such as an interest-free XRP loan to list the token, claimed that the exchange did not cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason for declining its offer.â€œCoinbase never ever raised the issue of whether or not XRP is a security in our discussions about listing XRP,â€ù Johnson said. â€œWeâ€™re 100 percent clear, itâ€™s not a security. We donâ€™t meet the standards.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/xrp-100-percent-not-a-security-ripple-claims/
Islamic Scholar Says Bitcoin is Compliant With Sharia Law as Price Surges,1523557568,"A recent declaration by an Islamic scholar that Bitcoin is compliant with Sharia law could be the cause behind todayâ€™s $1000 price surge, opening the market to Muslim investors who were previously unsure if the cryptocurrency qualified as money under the strict definitions outlined by scholars.Muslims account for 23% of the worldâ€™s population, with 1.6 billion Muslims throughout the world, mostly in Asia Pacific nations like India and Indonesia. Sharia Law, or Islamic Canonical Law, prohibits the practice of lending money at high-interest rates, known as usury. Debate has raged since the popularity of Bitcoin in the Islamic Scholar community as to whether Bitcoin trading was a form of usury due to the volatility and huge profit and loss margins.As the fastest growing religion in the world, Islam has become a central issue for financial authorities of late, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) holding their first formal discussion about Islamic banking needs last year. In Islam, commodities with an intrinsic value (gold, silver, salt) are considered currency. Fiat money actually stands on thinner ice than commodities when it comes to being considered Islamic money â€“ digital or paper money is usually only permitted if it is backed by a commodity of intrinsic value and at a fixed exchange rate. The gold standard allows for gold-backed currencies to be Sharia compliant, for example.Bitcoin has been a difficult currency to quantify, acting as a commodity and a currency all at once. It does, however, fall under certain definitions of customary money in Sharia law â€“ anything that becomes widely accepted as currency by society or government mandate.Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, a Sharia adviser and compliance officer at Blossom Finance in Jakarta,  published a paper on whether Bitcoin is Halal (permitted) or Haram (forbidden) on Tuesday 10 April.The paper essentially ruled that in certain cases, Bitcoin can indeed be Halal, permitted.An excerpt read:â€œIn Germany, Bitcoin is recognized as a legal currency and therefore qualifies as Islamic money in Germany. In countries such as the US, Bitcoin lacks official legal monetary status but is accepted for payment at a variety of merchants, and therefore qualifies as Islamic customary money.â€ùSharia has strong ideas about the preservation of wealth, something that has led ICOs and the volatile crypto-trading market to be viewed in a negative light. Bitcoin and blockchain technology, however, actually align well with Sharia ideology. Fractional reserve banking where ownership of the money involved is considered usury, which is forbidden. Because blockchain undeniably proves ownership, it is actually more compliant with Sharia than banking, and this was all included in the paper published by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar. The ruling comes only one day after a major Islamic scholar conference concerning cryptocurrencies, demonstrating that this has become a pressing issue among the Muslim population.As Muslims account for almost 1 in 4 people in the world, the ruling could open up the market to many investors who were previously avoiding it for religious reasons, something that we may well already be seeing with the recent surge in Bitcoin value.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-declared-compliant-with-sharia-law-price-surges/

Partnering with Tech Bureau Europe, the family-operated Chronoswiss promises a sophisticated yet elegant marriage of Japanese technology and timeless Swiss design.In total, five luxurious crypto watch design series has been introduced, each with only 101 pieces produced in a limited edition manufacture and only available through the Zaif cryptocurrency exchange.The five ranges will take on conceived aspects of their individual cryptocurrency which include Bitcoin as the currency, NEM as the harvest, Ethereum as the contract, Zaif as the exchange and COMSA as the token.The crypto range is based on its latest Flying Regulator Open Gear and the unusual Chronoswiss design. A design which features a dial, that doubles as a module board, onto which the train wheel bridges of skeletonized gears are mounted.The crypto watches are distinguished by several features including a regulator movement with off-center hour and second displays, a central design element of their regulator mechanism, a technically integrated 3-D dial bearing a custom-made logo to reflect each crypto edition, an elaborately skeletonized second display and in the dial logo print.Each watch is painstakingly hand-crafted in the Atelier Lucerne and will also bear a hand-painted individual serial number to specify its limited production. On the back is a skeletonized, red gold-plated rotor with a crypto logo visible through a sapphire glass back. All this encased within solid stainless steel with ultra hard, scratch-resistant, diamond-like carbon coating (5.000 Vickers).With modern flourishes designed to please the most demanding of aesthetics, these new Chronoswiss watches do not depart from a long-standing reputation of the highest-quality material and workmanship, with authentic touches and meticulous finishing accompanying each piece.Already recognized for their quality and value, the Chronoswiss crypto watches will appeal to watch lovers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

While the crisis led to a decline in Swiss watchmaking, Chronoswiss defiantly developed purely mechanical watches, insisting on retaining tradition connected to vision, a belief that stands today.Oliver believes cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are a dazzling aspect of the companyâ€™s future. With its homage to cryptocurrencies, Chronoswiss aims to link the roots of traditional watchmaking with the digital revolution of new world currencies.The limited edition Chronoswiss crypto watches can only be bought on auction via the Zaif cryptocurrency exchange, which will take place between April 13th to 27th, 2018.Watches will be listed in the same way as tokens, with customers placing bids as buy orders.

"Santander Uses Ripple, Launches First Banking Blockchain Retail Payments App",1523553649,"Spanish banking giant Banco Santander has announced the launch of its international payments app for retail customers in four countries using xCurrent, Rippleâ€™s blockchain technology.Santander is laying claim as the â€œfirst bank to roll out a blockchain-based international payments service to retail customers in multiple countries simultaneouslyâ€ù with the launch of One Pay FX, in a statement today. The launch of the smartphone app will initially be available to retail customers in Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Poland before a wider release to more countries in the coming months.â€œFrom today, customers in the UK can use One Pay to transfer money across Europe and to the US. In Spain, customers can transfer to UK and US, while customers in Brazil and Poland can transfer to the UK,â€ù Banco Santanderâ€™s executive chairman Ana Botin said in a statement.Notably, customers will be offered different payment options depending on their recipientsâ€™ destination. Santander users in Spain will be able to send pounds to the UK whereas customers in Brazil and Poland can send sterling pounds the UK, the bank explained.Santander is using Rippleâ€™s xCurrent, an enterprise blockchain software developed by the San Francisco-based FinTech giant to power end-to-end tracking of payments and instant settlements around the world. The platform, notably, does not use Rippleâ€™s native cryptocurrency XRP to power the blockchain.As reported previously, Santander has said that the app will enable international payments with merely â€œ3 clicks and 40 secondsâ€ù, a claim that is yet to be independently verified with a real-world transfer at press time.â€œTransfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,â€ù Botin elaborated, adding:Our goal is to help the thousands of people who use international payments services every day, and we will be adding more currencies and destinations in the coming months.While Santander proactively becomes the first European bank to use blockchain technology to power a core banking process, a consortium of over 61 Japanese banks â€“ collectively responsible 80% of the countryâ€™s banking assets â€“ is also working toward the launch of a similar retail consumer payments app using Rippleâ€™s technology.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/santander-uses-ripple-to-launch-first-banking-blockchain-retail-payments-app/
Former JPMorgan Trader Goes Bullish: â€˜Bitcoin is the Play at the Momentâ€™,1523550547,"Danny Masters, a commodities trader turned CoinShares chairman, has been a bitcoin believer since 2014, having recognized early the top cryptocurrencyâ€™s use cases as both a disrupter of gold and fiat money.Masters, who in a former life led the energy trading desk at JPMorgan and whose funds are having a â€œstrong year this year,â€ù told CNBC bitcoin is the play at the moment.â€œI like bitcoin. I think weâ€™ve seen a lot of liquidation, I think weâ€™ve seen a lot of leverage come out of the market, which was probably a little too risky for some people to hold onto and thatâ€™s come out.â€ùIn addition to bitcoin, the other play this year is â€œselect projectsâ€ù in the altcoin/ICO/ERC20 space, he said, pointing to â€œgood developers and non-forkable/blockchain specific ideas, you can select tokens that have been beaten down and are quite attractive in this market.â€ùMasters also suggested in the panel discussion on CNBC that itâ€™s a mistake to compare cryptos to other asset classes. Instead, he prefers to listen to industry veterans who have been around cryptocurrencies for the past five years and who â€œwill give you a very, very different feelâ€ù than the research being put out by traditional Wall Street firms such as Bank of America.He also made a tongue and cheek remark about Bank of Americaâ€™s grouping bitcoin among the â€œbiggest asset bubbles in history,â€ù saying â€œhe doesnâ€™t remember their bullish call on [bitcoinâ€™s] way up.â€ùâ€œBitcoin is a very difficult market to analyze. There are metrics that donâ€™t exist in the markets that we traditionally know and love,â€ù Masters said.When Masters first started trading cryptocurrencies, he noticed some parallels to when he first started trading commodities like oil, saying back at the turn of the century when he was â€œcommodities-focused,â€ù he connected the dots for a forthcoming commodities rally, but he â€œdidnâ€™t think weâ€™d find the answer and the proof for many years to come.â€ùHe said thatâ€™s a parallel to cryptocurrencies.â€œI think the setup is there, the story is convincing and the technology is convincing. We may not  know the proof for another 10 years.â€ùAnd while oil and commodities have unique characteristics and experienced events that were game-changing and that opened up the price dynamics for that market, cryptocurrencies have their own story, too.â€œThe use cases for crypto are bitcoin is disrupting money and gold. Ethereum is disrupting the formation of capital. There are other protocols that are disrupting identity, identity provenance. And these things are really unproven yet but quite promising.â€ù â€” MastersMasters is behind the marketâ€™s maiden bitcoin and Ethereum publicly traded notes, and now heâ€™s backing some ICOs.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/former-jpmorgan-trader-bitcoin-is-the-play-at-the-moment/
GRAIN: Work Agreements Blockchain Project Sets New Dates for ICO,1523547492,"Chiasso, Switzerland, Apr. 11, 2018 // After reaching their soft cap and postponing the public token sale due to changed regulations, Grain announces that its ICO will run from April 16th until May 7th.While originally having planned to go live on March 1st, Grain decided to postpone its public token sale after Swiss regulator FINMA announced its new guidelines for ICOâ€™s.

Onno Hektor â€“ Grainâ€™s CEO & President of the board â€“ explains.The first blockchain-based back-office solution for processing work agreements now sets out to collect the necessary funds to spread its solution across the world, after it exceeded its soft cap of 4000 ETH during the presale.Contrary to other projects in the HR market, Grain is not a marketplace to help companies find and hire freelancers. Instead, Grain is an infrastructure solution enabling companies to process labor contracts through the blockchain and to automate payments.By moving work agreements to the blockchain, the Grain solution helps companies remove a lot of the costs related to processing work agreements, such as payroll costs, transaction fees and currency conversion charges.Especially with the evolution towards a dynamic workforce, a more flexible solution to organize work â€“ Grain â€“ will be the cornerstone to make that happen.Grain is founded by CEO Onno Hektor; a former senior executive for Microsoft, and board member AndrÃ© Bonvanie; a serial entrepreneur. Their backgrounds in building scalable sales organizations form a strong foundation for turning Grain into a great company.They have recruited a highly experienced team of cryptocurrency professionals and business advisors to ensure the success of the platform. Not only are they joined by HR experts (including a former COO of Randstad and a senior university lecturer), Grain also has experts in IT security, insurance and other business veterans on board.During the ICO, Grain will offer 1,080,000,000 tokens, valued at 0.000037 ETH per GRAIN token (or 27000 GRAIN per 1 ETH). The minimum contribution is 0.5 ETH. Prospective investors can register their interest at the GRAIN website.Thereâ€™s also a bonus for participants contributing within the first seven days: a bonus of 10% during the first 48 hours, and 5% during the following five days.How transactions work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm4vYO56-ZYInterview with the founders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro0DmPPrA-4&;Interview about the roadmap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND6ijtegHhEMedia ContactName: Philippe VanderhoydonckLocation: Chiasso, SwitzerlandEmail: pr@grain.ioVisit the GRAIN website: https://grain.ioRead the whitepaper: https://grain.io/whitepaperJoin GRAIN on BitcoinTalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2766557.0Chat with GRAIN on Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/IAWYn0jj2m02434fbd73TgSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGSjeO28gA7EhtLjpJ8vldALinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/onnohektorFollow GRAIN on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Grain_ioJoin GRAIN on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/grain.ioChat with GRAIN on Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/KryGjFv",1,https://www.ccn.com/grain-work-agreements-blockchain-project-sets-new-dates-for-ico/
Cryptocurrency Market Cap Clips $300 Billion as Bear Trap Liquidates Shorts,1523546962,"The cryptocurrency market cap briefly clipped the $300 billion mark on Thursday, a phenomenon that occurred as the result of an apparent bear trap in the Bitcoin futures markets.Fueled by a dramatic Bitcoin price rally, the cryptocurrency market cap surged by more than $30 billion, peaking at $301.8 billion before settling back down to a present value of $298 billion. This represents a single-day increase of 12 percent, one of the marketâ€™s largest intraday rallies since December.The Bitcoin price led the rally, surging more than $1,000 in less than an hour and briefly surmounting the $8,000 checkpoint. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $7,740 on Bitfinex â€” a 24-hour gain of 11 percent â€” and has a market cap of just under $130 billion.Analysts largely attributed the precipitous surge to a â€œbear trap,â€ù which occurs when futures and margin traders attempt to short an asset but have their positions liquidated due to a price increase, forcing them to buy at market prices to cover their position.Matthew Newton, an analyst at crypto brokerage eToro told CCN:â€œWhilst there has been some stability in the cryptocurrency markets over recent weeks, weâ€™ve seen a record number of short positions building on major exchanges. When the price began to rise this afternoon, a large number of shorts with big positions were squeezed. The resulting interest from buyers increased momentum, causing the price to jump $1000 in 30 minutes.â€ùâ€œThe ratio of short margin trades versus longs has been increasing recently,â€ù Nick Kirk, quantitative developer and data scientist at Cypher Capital, told CNBC. â€œBuying volume ticked up today and a lot of these short trades got liquidated, helping fuel the rally.â€ùThe Bitcoin bear trap rippled throughout the market, and most â€” though not all â€” altcoins made significant gains against the US dollar. The Ethereum price, for instance, rose 10 percent on Bitfinex and is currently trading at $463. Ethereum now has a $45.5 billion market cap.The vast majority of altcoins posted similar rallies, though the gains were far from evenly distributed and one large-cap altcoin â€” sixth-ranked Litecoin â€” trailed the index by a considerable margin.The Ripple price made an 11 percent leap to $0.55, raising the third-largest cryptocurrencyâ€™s market cap to $21.5 billion. Bitcoin Cash, meanwhile, trailed the index by three percent but still managed to surpass the $700 mark.EOS, continuing its parabolic midweek rally, is up 31 percent for the day, bringing its price to $8.96 and market cap to $7.1 billion.Litecoin posted the worst performance among top 10-cryptocurrencies, rising just six percent to $121, while seventh-ranked Cardano climbed by 23 percent.Stellar and NEO rose 11 percent and 12 percent, respectively, while IOTAâ€™s 14 percent rally to $1.18 rounded out the top 10.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-market-cap-clips-300-billion-as-bear-trap-liquidates-shorts/
"ICO Rocati, The First Cryptocurrency That Allows to Buy a Real Estate Property",1523546567,"When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the economic establishment suggests prudence to people, but now a real revolution has emerged in the sector, represented by the Rocati, which has its strength in bricks, a timeless asset that has always meant security for investors.It is time for cryptocurrencies to make a real leap in quality. The ROCATI concretizes this need by distinguishing itself from other types of electronic money riding the wave of Bitcoinâ€™s success: this digital currency will grow through a concrete good: bricks and mortar. Its value will be consolidated with real estate transactions, and this means that there is no risk of the kind of speculative bubble that finance experts fear with other cryptocurrencies.From now on it will be easier to buy a house. A cryptocurrency has been born that will help young couples to buy a property and to transform old apartments into modern homes, revaluing them and reducing energy consumption. The Rocati is a currency that does not need an enormous use of electricity for its production, as is required by Bitcoin, and also through the project of restructuring houses it helps to reduce energy waste by protecting the environment. All this is possible with this new currency, which will see its debut on the market in April. The project stems from the intuition of Emanuele Pinzi, a young graduate in engineering with a specialization in interior architecture in the United States, who has brought together the needs of ordinary people and those of the real estate market: a new form of investment that anticipates the future.The other cryptocurrencies have a purely speculative origin and it is normal that they are perceived as a high-risk investment. The ROCATI has the function of disengaging people from the banking intermediaries that with their own behavior have proved to be an unreliable channel. This currency is a financial instrument that has within it a social soul that is useful to the community.The real estate sector is the most important lever of the economy, and restarting it is fundamental for all countries. Creating added value in this sector is essential to deliver into the hands of citizens the security they have lost in investing their savings. The ROCATI, in addition to defending the resources of workers and retirees, also beckons to investors who want to diversify their portfolios. The dream of young couples to create a family by sidestepping all the banking bureaucracy to get a mortgage is becoming a reality. This new method will significantly affect real estate transactions, increasing the GDP of countries, and redistributing wealth in a healthy way to consolidate the future of citizens.The ROCATI is linked to Itarco, a network of real estate agencies supported by a company that will guarantee credit through the transferable compromise, a form of rent to buy that makes your home unassailable and will eliminate the rent charges paid by the majority of citizens in every country. This act makes the asset acquired inviolable, respecting the great value that the property represents. This procedure secures the financial resources of the buyer, ensuring full enjoyment of the property purchase. The person intending to buy a property will receive a mortgage equal to 100% of the value. The transparency of the operations is guaranteed by a software program through which the notary can register the deed directly on the blockchain of the currency. Those who buy ROCATI know that the currencyâ€™s appreciation is linked to real estate transactions, not to speculation, and this brick of security will create conditions for a peaceful future.In 2017 the value of real estate transactions in Italy amounted to â‚¬ 118 billion, with an increase of 14%, while in the world, this asset reaches the sum of 217 trillion dollars. According to surveys by real estate observatories, the Italian housing stock is rather obsolete, and only a quarter of households are contemplating renovation work. The ROCATI allows you to buy a house that will be revalued in a short time thanks to a restructuring carried out through a team of architects, at a cost divided into convenient instalments within the thirty-year mortgage.",1,https://www.ccn.com/ico-rocati-the-first-cryptocurrency-that-allows-to-buy-a-real-estate-property/
Infinity Economics: A New Blockchain Ecosystem; Equipped with Total Economic and Financial Features,1523546183,"The previous two years can be called the years of cryptocurrencies as in the past two years Bitcoin has reached every corner of the world. While the journey of cryptocurrencies continues; it is not as fast as before. There might be many reasons to this including timely regulations that are being exercised by various countries. These regulations are resultant of the fact that cryptocurrencies are independent of central authorities such as governments and banks owing to their decentralized nature.On the other hand, there are some limitations associated with Bitcoin. Bitcoin can manage a mere seven transactions per second when credit card companies can process up to 100,000 transactions per second. The lack of suitability to mass market was the main reason why some developers got together to analyze and optimize the knowledge of previous cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin in 2012. A new, improved Blockchain has successfully been developed: The Infinity Economics platform and the XIN Coin. The Infinity Economics platform places great emphasis on transaction speed to ensure that XIN is used as a digital currency as XIN in practice. This is because coin transactions take place between two wallets. It works in the same way as that of a bank wire, but here, it is based on encrypted messages. The confirmation time for a transaction differs depending on the cryptocurrency and that is what making all the difference.On January 10, 2017, 9 billion XIN Coins were generated by a Genesis process like that of a â€œbig bangâ€ù, and were distributed entirely to the largest founding community so far. Since then, the Infinity Economics platform has brought together the best of all blockchain developments. It builds the foundation for endless use cases on the blockchains. A very promising feature of the Infinity Economics platform is its automated transactions (AT), also known as smart contracts. These intelligent (smart) contracts are small programs that automatically fulfil the conditions of a contract according to a predetermined procedure (if-then-else-logic). They can be deployed on the Infinity Economics blockchain, and they have the potential to enable use of the Internet of things to the mass market.It also facilitates Asset Exchange which permits the investment, purchase and sale of asset. This also permits the presentation of data beyond simple coin trading. This creates diverse new opportunities for businesses. The Asset Exchange Facilitation is based on the coloured coin concept, where a coin or a set of coins can be firmly designated to represent something else.The Escrow Service in the platform enables secure payments by retaining the buyerâ€™s coins until the terms of the sale are met and the buyer releases the payment to the seller. This eliminates disputes, and removes needs of any further measures by third parties. The XIN tokens which are central to the platform facilitates anonymous transactions in less than 60 seconds with its secure wallet. Users can also create and send simple text messages within the decentralized blockchain. They can also replace system-defined names with your own texts to use key terms or phrases. The subscribed users get the liberty to terminate the recurring payment any time they want. It is quite obvious that the creation of additional funds (coins) act as basic building block of the monetary system on the Infinity Economics platform.As far as new businesses are concerned, they can make use of Infinity Economics to finance existing or future projects in a novel and innovative way. Since its inception, Infinity Economics Platform has been a 100% community-led project which implies, the deciding power of all community members corresponds to their voting power. Voting is also done using consensus-based blockchain technology which enables completely transparent elections that are totally secure against counterfeiting, while ensuring the anonymity of each participant without having to rely on a central monitoring body. This approach essentially makes infinity economics a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). All the processes including platform development; marketing; documentation and everything else are organized in a decentralized manner. Therefore, the â€œpowerâ€ù rests with the users â€“ the only consistent and fair approach for a blockchain as that is the only way to eliminate sources of error. The platform has been designed for users to decide independently of major investors, developers or founders.Media ContactName : Abhimanyu KumarEmail : marketing@infinity-economics.orgPhone : +91-8817751713",1,https://www.ccn.com/infinity-economics-a-new-blockchain-ecosystem-equipped-with-total-economic-and-financial-features/
Bytecoin Asian Market Update,1523545819,"Bytecoin, which is known to be one of the leaders in anonymous cryptocurrency, has made an intermediate summary regarding their Asian expansion and is moving forward with major updates in the Far East market.The Asian cryptocurrency market has proven to be the area with the biggest potential in the blockchain world, according to several price and volume aggregators. Despite the fact that there were several rumors about bans and restrictions, many countries in Asia have been the most involved in crypto trading, development, and education. As a result, the Bytecoin team has decided to start their Asian expansion by building local communities, including Korean, Chinese, Japanese, as well as other local ones, and getting listings on major Asian exchanges.Due to the high demand in the Asian community for trading with the first private cryptocurrency built on CryptoNote technology, the Bytecoin team has started to cooperate with popular Asian blockchain-related corporations, including major exchanges, C2C or â€œdecentralisedâ€ù services, marketplaces, etc. This is the main objective for every project willing and interested in entering this new market. The Team has successfully gone through many difficulties, found local representatives and supporters who know the local markets and the mentality of the people living there, as well as sped up all of the business actions (cooperation/processes).During the 2nd quarter of 2018, the Bytecoin team is going to be expanding its operation towards the Middle East market, one of the biggest pools of investors which will undoubtedly bring a new wave of investments to the Bytecoin cryptocurrency market. The Team still considers the Asian market as one of its biggest priorities for Bytecoin in 2018 and will force the business processes to announce the upcoming partnerships. But by diversifying its focus Bytecoin will be able to expand to even more and greater markets around the world.Thanks to the early steps performed by the Bytecoin team at the beginning of this year, a base for further successful expansion has been placed and made possible. There is still plenty of work to do in the near future, however, the team is ready to move ahead and face whatever challenges the market will bring on the horizon.",1,https://www.ccn.com/bytecoin-asian-market-update/
Consentium Raises Additional US$ 10 Million to Build First-Of-Its-Kind Fintech Chat App,1523545520,"Singapore, April 5, 2018 â€“  Consentium, Asiaâ€™s first multi-digital currency and group monetisation chat application, has announced today that it has raised a total of USD$20 million after the latest round of its private sale. This follows a previous raise of USD$10 million which was completed in March 2018.â€œConsentium is re-defining what a mobile chat app does. Not only can our users communicate with friends, families and people in their networks, but also uniquely monetize their in-app experiences. We are immensely pleased with follow-on funding into Consentium which demonstrates a healthy investment appetite from investors to build our vision of a fintech and community first chat app.â€ù said Hal Bame, co-founder of Consentium.In March 2018, Consentium announced its partnership with the security firm ThothTrust to manage the overall security for Consentium, mainly focused on wallet encryption methods. Through its Customizable Secure Cryptography (CSC) product, ThothTrust provides a consultation and customisation service to secure the companyâ€™s critical crypto assets. What this secure hardware service does is it stores, processes and executes cryptocurrency transactions for Consentium and its users. For users to access these services, secure identification will be required.On Friday, 23 March 2018, Consentium also held its first sharing session in Singapore, with a turnout of 150 attendees. The event called â€œConsentium Presents: Regulations and Economics of Cryptocurrencies Todayâ€ù covered information around the parameters of cryptocurrencies in Singapore. Speakers included Peter Sin and Caleb Yap, Co-Founders of Singapore Bitcoin Club, Nizam Ismail, legal advisor for Consentium, as well as Hal Bame, CEO & Co-Founder of Consentium, who shared more around the platformâ€™s unique concept of monetising the creation and participation of community chat groups.Insights from the packed-out event helped drive interest in Consentiumâ€™s pre-sale, as its pre-sale cap of USD$20 million was achieved within the initial hours of the one-day pre-sale. To cater to the overwhelming interest registered, Consentium will be extending its public sale dates to run from April 15th (1800hrs GMT +6) through April 30th (1800hrs GMT +6).Consentium is the first chat application to reward its users with cryptocurrency for any group or community they create.

Strong Demand on OTC Market in 2018. Is OTCBTC a Localbitcoins Killer?,1523545012,"Cryptocurrencies have performed exceptionally well in 2017 and are continuing to attract new investors in 2018. As regulators have become increasingly attentive to the cryptocurrency markets, restrictions have been placed on deposit-taking banks. â€œI want to invest in cryptocurrencies, but the issue in Bulgaria is the fiat withdrawals and deposits from bank accounts. Recently, banks blocked all transactions connected with cryptocurrency trading.â€ù said one trader from Bulgaria.While many people find they have difficulties funding their account with fiat currency to a fiat-crypto exchange due to the restrictions on banks, some of them have already been using a more comfortable and faster way to trade â€“ the OTC Market. Recently, trading firms are adopting Skype to negotiate, buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. This is convenient for people who want trade large blocks, but it is not practical for an average person who wants to buy a small amount of cryptocurrencies. Besides, trust is an issue for skype settlements.However, an OTC exchange makes it secure and fast for a normal trader or a crypto beginner. It builds the trust in a trustless environment. You can think of an OTC exchange as an â€œeBay for Cryptoâ€ù, where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies to and from others using fiat currencies. OTC cryptocurrency trading has been going on for years. For example, LocalBitcoins is the most well-known peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange. Users create advertisements with the price and the payment method they want to offer. They can also search for advertisements and prefered payment methods.OTCBTC is a cryptocurrency exchange platform developed with Rails. Founded in October 2017, it has grown rapidly since its launch and has reached hundreds of millions of dollars in trading volume, and pageviews, within two short months. This platform has its own token called OTB, which can be used to pay the fees on the OTCBTC platform. The deduction is automatically applied according to the current market price through the system. In Janauray 2018, the team launched crypto exchange. Users are able to trade various altcoins on the platform with BTC, ETH and USDT pairs. As OTCBTC continues to gain support from the community, it is becoming the leading OTC exchange in Asia.LocalbitcoinsOTCBTCCryptocurrenciesBTCBTC/ETH/BCH/USDT/LTC/EOS/ZCASH/QTUM and other cryptocurrencies.67 different currencies in totalFeesFree for buying & selling1% for posting an ad with completed tradingFree for buying & selling0.3% for  ETH0.5% for othersOther Discount / MembershipNOMil member 0.1%Mi2 member 0.2%OTB discount.

They both provide a secure and fast way for fiat-crypto trading to investors across the word. Though Localbitcoins is currently the most well-known marketplace with various fiat currency support. The lack of improvement and certain limitations, as mentioned in the table, gives OTCBTC an edge over Localbitcoins in the near future.To know more about the OTCBTC exchange and explore its features, please visit https://otcbtc.com/Find OTCBTC onTwitter: https://twitter.com/otcbtcTelegram: https://t.me/otcbtc_enBlog: https://medium.com/otcbtc",1,https://www.ccn.com/strong-demand-on-otc-market-in-2018-is-otcbtc-a-localbitcoins-killer/
"ZODIAQ, the First Crypto-Fiat Bank, Has Joined FATCA and SWIFT",1523544447,"We are pleased to announce that ZODIAQ bank has become compliant with FATCA and has obtained a GIIN. This information is available via the IRS website found here.Previously, in January 2018, the bank joined SWIFT (BIC value: CRYTKMK1), and the code is available on their website beginning since March 2018.FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) is a US law that requires that foreign financial institutions (FFI) to report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service). This law seeks to enhance monitoring of assets and currency movements with a view to prevent money laundering and tax evasion by US taxpayers.Upon registration and approval, each FFI is assigned a GIIN (Global Intermediary Identification Numbers). From then onward, such institution can provide services legally to US citizens and businesses. As for ZODIAQ, now it can open accounts and carry out all kinds of banking transactions in fiat and cryptocurrencies.Connection to SWIFT is another important step toward the integration of ZODIAQ bank to the international banking industry. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) operated a network enabling its members to send and receive information about financial transactions. This network links more than 12 000 institutions and major corporations in 215 countries.SWIFT carries over half a million financial messages daily with a total amount of transactions estimating at several billion dollars.This doesnâ€™t limit to bank-to-bank transfers and payments, but also includes securities, travellerâ€™s cheques, and other financial instruments.Erik Shekhmametev, COO of ZODIAQ, said, â€œThis is the first case of a bank licensed for cryptocurrency operations to join FATCA and SWIFT.

"Vietnam Investigates Alleged $660 Million ICO Fraud of Pincoin, Ifan",1523543075,"Vietnamese authorities have asked local ministries and the police to investigate two allegedly fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) that conned 32,000 investors out of a staggering $660 million.The operators of the purported â€˜cryptocurrencyâ€™ startups fundamentally conducted multi-level marketing schemes, local news outlet Tuoi Tre News reports, pointing the finger at Pincoin and Ifan that claim to be from Dubai and Singapore respectively. The two startups raised money through initial coin offerings under the control of Ho Chi Minh-based Modern Tech, the alleged operator who claims to be the authorized local representative for the two schemes in the country.An estimated 32,000 investors were persuaded into investing into the schemes that incentivized older investors to rope in new investors. In a further sign of a brazen ponzi fraud, Pincoin â€“ which claims to be an Ethereum standard ERC-20 token â€“ claims to offer investors returns of up to 40% every month on its website that is complete with a picture of a yellow Lamborghini.While details are scarce about the longevity of the two alleged scams, investors reportedly began to sense trouble after Modern Tech stopped paying commissions in Vietnamese dong, the countryâ€™s fiat currency. Instead, they were paid in tokens which were never redeemable for cash, the report added.It wasnâ€™t long before investors turned up at Modern Techâ€™s office in downtown Ho Chi Minh to demand compensation from the company. The queries quickly turned to protests with dozens of disgruntled investors holding banners in front of the company including one that reads: â€œCryptocurrency â€“ the biggest multi-level scams, more than 15 trillion dongâ€ù ($658 million), pictures on social media showed.A report from local publication Viet Bao the owner of the building that housed Modern Tech said the company had â€œalready left and annulled its contractâ€ù in March. â€œNo one knows where they are moving now,â€ù he added.A group of seven Vietnamese nationals are described as the â€˜mastermindsâ€™ of promoting the alleged scams across Vietnam including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, the countryâ€™s two biggest cities.The severity of the alleged scams, both in scale of its operation and the reported losses suffered by victims, has seen the office of Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Vietnamâ€™s Prime Minister, publish a directive ordering the State Bank of Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Securities and other authorities to reinforce and strengthen the management of â€œactivities related to bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesâ€ù.A separate statement from Vietnamâ€™s deputy prime minister Vuong Dinh Hue has ordered six governmental ministries to â€œquickly consider and take downâ€ù the scam.While Vietnam was reported to have been preparing to legalize legitimate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in mid-2017, the central bank has since enforced laws to prohibit the usage of bitcoin as legal tender in the country.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/vietnam-investigates-alleged-660-million-ico-fraud-of-pincoin-ifan/

Luckchemy Makes Coinagenda 2018,1524010777,"This is a submitted sponsored story. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.Puerto Rico. Warm weather. Calm. Heaven on earth. But only for tourists. Nowadays, Coinagenda 2018 â€” the first conference for Bitcoin investors â€” takes place here.Dramatic atmosphere. Investors are holding their breath waiting for results. And finally, we have them!In addition to winners voted on by judges, Coinagenda audience members are encouraged to vote for their favorite presenter on Superbloomâ€™s platform.Luckchemy is the most attractive project at Coinagenda. The first CMOâ€™s speech proved it. Mark Beck`s presentation was very successful and Luckchemy won the first place according to Superbloom. Company got $25 000 token redemption.4 minute speech of Luckchemyâ€™s CMO Mark Beck referred to online gambling market perspectives and algorithms of the platform. It provided a great example of how you could win the attention of investors and experts in the short speech.In his presentation Mark Beck showed great opportunities for users of the Luckchemy platform. 300 million gross gaming revenue worldwide excluding lotteries, including grey, black and white markets. 128 billion worldwide gross gaming revenue. Itâ€™s a huge market which is ready for disruption.Luckchemy team got the first investments even before the private sale has started on April 2. This means trust. 33% investors and experts gave their votes for Luckchemy. Why did it happen? Nowadays, online casinos are no longer credible for users. So Luckchemy made a platform driven by Blockchain technology. No taxes, no banking commissions, just transparency and complete anonymity at the same time.On Luckchemy platform 99% of funds collected from lottery ticket sales will be allocated to the prize pool of lottery. There are no such examples on the market. Luckchemy has already made MVP version of the product. All users can check first Luckchemy game â€“ lottery and win virtual tokens. Virtual tokens will automatically be transferred into real tokens after I_¡O. Other platform users can also check the Luckchemy platform and compare it with other solutions, making some conclusions.In addition to games created by Luckchemy developers, platform will also give possibilities for known game creators to launch their products.

Data Firm at Center of Facebook Controversy Planned $30 Million ICO: Report,1523998658,"Cambridge Analytica, a British data analytics firm, was planning to raise as much as $30 million by issuing a new cryptocurrency through an ICO before it got swept up in a scandal surrounding the misuse of Facebook Inc. personal data, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.Cambridge Analytica had approached a company that advises companies on how structuring ICOs, the sources said.Cambridge Analyticaâ€™s current plans are unknown. An unnamed spokesman said the company is considering using blockchain to help secure its online data, but did not comment on the ICO.The company was creating technologies to allow people to reclaim personal data and gain complete transparency over how their data is used before the Facebook controversy erupted, the spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.Cambridge Analytica worked for U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 election campaign and has faced scrutiny over the past month after the Observer and the New York Times reported that the firm improperly gained access to personal data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook earlier this month acknowledged data from more than 87 million users could have been compromised.Cambridge Analytica has said it properly licensed data on a much smaller number of users from a research firm.The companyâ€™s effort to provide personal data protection was overseen by its chief executive, Alexander Nix, who left in March after being tape recorded boasting about the companyâ€™s use of shell companies and strategies to help politicians entrap opponents, The New York Times reported.The New York Times also reported Cambridge Analytica attempted to promote the Dragon Coin, a coin associated with a Macau gangster known as Broken Tooth. Dragon coin was to be used by gamblers and make it easier for people to get money to Macau casinos.Facebook, meanwhile, is curtailing misleading and deceptive ad practices, including ICOs, cryptocurrencies and binary options, banning ads that â€œpromote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/data-firm-tied-at-center-of-facebook-controversy-planned-30-million-ico-report/

The introduction of this licensing process in 2014 led to what the New York Business Journal described as the â€œGreat Bitcoin Exodus,â€ù and only a small number of companies have managed to obtain a BitLicense in the years since.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who co-founded New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, also recently proposed creating a national self-regulatory body to govern and establish best practices for the nascent industry, which is currently regulated primarily at the state level.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/new-york-tells-cryptocurrency-exchanges-to-be-more-transparent/

Bolivar to Bitcoin Trading Surpasses a Record $1 Million per Day,1524174920,"Venezuelaâ€™s economic situation has been steadily declining in the past few years, bringing Venezuelans to turn to cryptocurrencies.According to VeneBloc data, the bolivar-to-bitcoin market recently reached a new record, as the equivalent of $1.009 million in bolivars were exchanged for bitcoin on April 17.VeneBloc tracks transactions made on peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins on the South American nation. It currently posts a rate of over 800,000 bolivars per dollar. Venezuelans are turning to cryptocurrencies as the government has enforced strict foreign exchange controls back in 2003.These controls see individuals and businesses who arenâ€™t able to obtain government approval to purchase dollars at legal rates turn to the black market. Cryptocurrencies help Venezuelans access foreign goods, and effectively survive government failures.Last year Jorge Farias, the co-founder of Venezuelan-based cryptocurrency brokerage Cryptobuyer, which had over 10,000 users at the time, said:â€œThe transaction takes a few minutes, our commission is three to seven percent lower than the banks, and our exchange rate is regulated by supply and demand, making it more realistic than the officialâ€ùVenezuelans have limited access to official foreign exchange markets, which makes it hard to get a sense of what their fiat currency is worth. Cryptocurrency exchanges help them here, along with websites tracking the rate to dollar auctions, and WhatsApp groups.Prices in Venezuela surged by 454 percent in the first quarter of this year, and a whopping 8,900 percent over the past 12 months. The hyperinflation has left the country on the brink of economic collapse, a problem that the government seemingly isnâ€™t addressing.Instead, Venezuelaâ€™s government is focusing on its oil-backed cryptocurrency the Petro (PTR), which recently received the â€œSatoshi Nakamoto Prizeâ€ù from the Russian Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Association. The Petro, through its initial token sale, is said to have raised more than $5 billion from investors throughout the world.While the countryâ€™s National Assembly and other entities bashed the Petroâ€™s sale, some analysts doubt it even exists. Meanwhile, the country has implied it may charge for exports in it and ordered state-owned businesses to accept it, which could create demand.As for its economy, the executive secretary of the countryâ€™s Blockchain Observatory, Daniel PeÃ±a, revealed he believes the oil-backed cryptocurrency will positively impact it within â€œthree to six months.â€ù In an interview to the countryâ€™s Cuatro F newspaper, he said:â€œThere are many advantages, among them is that the inflationary scheme of the Venezuelan economy breaks down. Stolen or stolen tickets, because it is a digital currency that is safe to handle and has more functionality. The intermediaries will disappear, it will be a directional purchase. The waiting time for transactions will be reduced, because it will be faster than the banking system.â€ùFeatured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/bolivar-to-bitcoin-market-surpasses-1-million-as-venezuela-focuses-on-petro/
Wall Street Veteran Likens Cryptocurrencies to Candy Crush Game Currency,1524171160,"Richard Bernstein isnâ€™t building any bridges with the cryptocurrency community.The head of the Wall Street research firm that bears his name said in a note to clients today that thereâ€™s little difference between cryptocurrencies and the virtual currencies you earn with internet games like Candy Crush, according to a report on Bloomberg. CryptoKitties might not be the smash hit it was cracked up to be, but it might have been a more viable comparison considering itâ€™s built on the Ethereum network.As Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin recently explained to CNBC, the value, at least for ETH, can be compared to commodities like oil, which trades for a price and â€œis a fuel that powers the global commerce platform. He said: â€œThe ether token is used to pay for computational steps and storage operations on the decentralized application platform that is Ethereum.â€ùMeanwhile, according to Bernstein, the difference between Candy Crushâ€™s in-game currency and the cryptocurrencies that bitcoin miners create and earn in exchange for solving complicated puzzles comes down to the fact that digital currencies can be traded. The speculative nature of trading cryptocurrencies qualifies the market for a bubble, says Bernstein, pointing to the following features of digital currencies as proof â€“Bernstein wouldnâ€™t be the first person to call cryptocurrencies a bubble, with some cryptocurrency market veterans having said in the past that not all of them will survive. And according to Bernsteinâ€™s note, trading in a bubble doesnâ€™t discredit the economic and business case of cryptocurrencies, though it â€œsuggests that the return-on-investment could be considerably lower than investors currently expect.â€ùBernstein is a Wall Street veteran, having previously served as Merrill Lynchâ€™s chief investment strategist, and heâ€™s weighed in on bitcoin before. He can analyze equity market analysts under the table, but when it comes to cryptocurrencies, heâ€™s skeptical. Bernstein said in a note to clients in December:â€œIt is ironic that [investors] fear traditional equities, but they do not fear cryptocurrencies. One must remember that risk typically lies in what youâ€™re invested in, and not in what you fearfully avoid.â€ùBitcoinâ€™s worth is derived from the value that people place on it, as itâ€™s not backed by any asset. But bitcoin is moving more into the mainstream for payments with the Lightning Network and altcoins like Bitcoin Cash have accelerated transaction times. As for bitcoinâ€™s other use case as a store of value, cryptocurrency trader Brian Kelly recently suggested that losing 25% from cryptocurrencies is â€œbetter than losing 100% â€_ by a â€œrogue government.â€ù Kelly is also of the opinion that the bitcoin price will attain a new high in 2018.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/wall-street-veteran-likens-cryptocurrencies-to-candy-crush-game-currency/
Wink & a Bitcoin: Roger Ver Offers Reddit $100k to Appoint New Moderator to Bitcoin Forum,1524167738,"Early cryptocurrency investor and ardent Bitcoin Cash supporter Roger Ver is known for using his social media presence to stir the pot, and he lived up to that reputation this week.Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com and has signed on to the â€œBitcoin Cash is Bitcoinâ€ù movement, offered to pay Reddit a bribe if the social media platform would appoint a moderator â€œwho supports free speechâ€ù to the Bitcoin subreddit, which has long been one of the most popular Bitcoin forums.â€œDear @reddit, I heard that as of recently you were not a profitable company. Iâ€™ll pay you $100,000 USD if you simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech,â€ù Ver wrote in a Wednesday tweet that included a link to an oft-shared blog post accusing the subreddit of censorship.Relations have grown tense between /r/Bitcoin and /r/BTC â€” the other major Bitcoin-related subreddit â€” over the years. The former has frequently been accused of censorship for its moderation of posts related to the years-long Bitcoin scaling debate, while the latter â€” of which Ver is a moderator â€” has become the de facto subreddit for Bitcoin Cash. Both, meanwhile, have been accused of tribalism.Verâ€™s tweet attracted its own of replies â€” and copycats.Some, like Bitcoin.org co-owner Cobra-Bitcoin, offered to pay for a moderator post on /r/BTC. Cobra-Bitcoin, for instance, offered the social media company $1 million to make him the â€œhead moderatorâ€ù of /r/BTC so that he could â€œmake the content of that subreddit better match the name.â€ùOthers poked fun at Ver for his tweet. One, for example, compared it to dogs complaining that they did not have more representation on a forum dedicated to cats.In any case, of course, Reddit does not need the money, even if it has yet to reach profitability. Last year, the company raised $200 million in funding, placing its total valuation at $1.8 billion.Featured image from Youtube.",1,https://www.ccn.com/wink-a-bitcoin-roger-ver-offers-reddit-100k-bribe-to-appoint-new-moderator-to-bitcoin-forum/
Cryptocurrencies: Is It Really a Land without Sheriffs?,1524163744,"In this opinion piece, Janis Graubins, co-Founder of Identity and Access Management company Notakey, follows the trial of a suspicious cryptocurrency wallet address and explains if and how illicit activity can be combated.We had the Wild West, where the cliche of the cowboy movies was the nearest sheriff is 90 miles away, and so you had to pack a gun and defend yourself. â€“Steven PinkerRegulators warn to be cautious, friends preach them as the next big thing. Whatâ€™s about cryptocurrencies? Are they solving real-life problems or are mainly used for money laundering? I will try to answer these questions in a series of articles.But letâ€™s start with the first questions I typically get when starting to talk about cryptocurrencies â€” if there is no central authority, who is responsible for fighting frauds? This is a very serious topic as things can go wrong even for experienced crypto investors such as Ian Balina:Does it eventually come up to the banks that allow exchanging cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies? And do they have right systems in place to pick up potential illegal activity? Or is it the case of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, where crime syndicates laundered more than A$75m through CBAâ€™s systems.I will first identify a suspicious wallet address that I will analyze. Then I will look into how end controls could help and if there should be controls at the start? Then I will ask myself if any controls should be put in the first place and what would happen if there are not? And finally, I will sum everything up and provide practical information on what can be helpful for fighting criminal activities.1. Identifying a suspicious address: to understand what can we do right, we need to understand how things can be done wrong.To understand what risks there are for potential money laundering in cryptocurrency space and if in case somebody would steal my funds I would be able to recover it, I started with taking one Ethereum address that according to comments is involved in several scams.And followed where the money goes to. From this account it was transferred to this one:My initial thoughts were letâ€™s use an existing service such as Coinfirm to make sense of all the transactions in the address. And that was what I did:The problem with the report, however, was that while it shows identified risks, it does not provide with context. Moreover, some of the risks that could be identified manually were not identified by Coinfirm at all:And these are just few. Others that were not identified were structured deposits, multiple output transactions, high-value addresses, ICO contributor etc. That is why I decided to continue with checking transactions manually.2. Can End controls stop money laundering? And what is Ethereum Mixer?When I looked further where the money flows from this account I was surprised that after being transferred to another account, it was split in smaller amounts and eventually sent to Shapeshift to lose tracks (Shapeshift is a company that allows exchanging one cryptocurrency to another).Initially, I thought that it might be done manually but after a while, I started to think that there might be an Ethereum Mixer involved. So what is it?Of course, it says it is all about privacy but who are we kidding here? What it does is take control of your wallet address, splits the amount and sends them to your end-address through other user accounts, newly created accounts and Shapeshift. This illustration sums it up nicely:And this is not one separate case. According to Satoshi fund research (they analyzed transactions that in a given period were equal to 68.5% in money terms) Ethereum Mixer counts for a large volume of all ETH transactions:But letâ€™s get back to our case. As we can see from the illustration of top output addresses, the funds are sent to Exchanges like Kraken. It should be that at this point the money laundering stops because of their Know Your Customer (KYC)procedure at Exchange? It should if the KYC would be reliable.And it is not much better with Tier 3 verification. In particular, the problem with the implementation of KYC is â€” it allows to allow upload photos of ID documents and yourself, instead of taking live photos.In the cryptocurrency world, creating an account with fake identity takes seconds. So if somebody has access to your photo and ID documents, that person can impersonate you. And to be frank, data breaches where ID documents are leaked happen quite often.3. Do we need to look the other way around? Should we put controls in the beginning?For this letâ€™s go back to the address we analysed. If we check from where the funds are coming from, we can see that they are from addresses that have received the funds by mining, participated in ICOs or bought and sold tokens through Exchanges.We can see that the address has many small incoming transactions. If we check that address in details it becomes clear that the funds come from mining.The only thing what is needed to mine ethereum or bitcoin is hardware that can be bought in any electronics shop. No KYC is required to join a mining pool. It basically means that there could be Government officials from North Korea mining bitcoin or ethereum and no one would know. They even would not need to buy hardware themselves as there are many services that sell hashing power for mining.Letâ€™s look first at Ubcoin ICO. Do they check from where the funds are coming from.According to their Telegram chat for funds below 50 eth (around $20k) it is not required to do any KYC at all. Money launderers could easily buy these tokens and then exchange to fiat currencies through Exchanges (when they are listed). Even better, they actually could create a fake ICO through which they launder the funds.Similar situation is with ModulTrade token that already is listed and has a questionable KYC in place.As it can be seen from the Telegram chat, it would be easily to impersonate another person as there is no face-matching in place.Of course, it is possible that both Ubcoin and ModulTrade have a solution for analyzing wallet transactions and in case the funds are coming from a source that looks suspicious, they might do enhanced due diligence. However, I could not find any information about that.4. Do we actually need to have any controls?I have talked a lot about downside of not having a KYC and not being able to track transactions due to Mixers, but what about cases where you are doing something legitimate but would still like to keep your privacy?For example, letâ€™s say I own a brothel in Switzerland from which I get profit every month. In Switzerland this is legal. But if I would live in Russia, where it is illegal, I might be cautious about showing my source of income. The same logic applies to several other use cases â€” e.g., if I would have a medical condition that requires buying medical marijuana that is allowed in one country but not in another.There are several more use cases, where keeping privacy makes sense. That is why ideally KYC would be required only where there are risks of money laundering. Nevertheless, the question is how to do it if so many people are trying to hide their tracks?5. Why should I care?As a company â€” you should care because the fines for not complying with AML rules are very high. E.g. JP Morgan case, where the bank paid a fine of $ 1.7 billion. Regulators across the world are looking into if cryptocurrencies should also be subject to the same law. Even if operations with cryptocurrencies will no be subject to AML rules, still all company funds can be frozen in case there is an ongoing investigation for a bank that holds all money of the company. For a business that is trying to be the next Google, this is a completely unnecessary risk as all the operations of the company might be suspended for an unknown time period.For individuals â€” not filing a suspicious transaction report, might lead to criminal charges carrying jail sentences for reporting entities and their directors, officers, agents, and employees.6. What could help?The first thing what needs to be done is set in place good KYC systems. With that I mean:To sum everything up â€” money laundering is possible but so is identifying these actions. Ethereum Mixers, ICOs and Mining Services make it more difficult to analyze if funds are not coming from a suspicious source, therefore, linking a wallet to a verified identity could help. Privacy is important, therefore ideal KYC solution should show that person has passed the check without revealing their identity.Featured image from United Artists/The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.",1,https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrencies-is-it-really-a-land-without-sheriffs/

Silicon Valley VCs Ask US Regulators to Go Easy on ICO Regulations,1524160863,"A duo of heavy-hitting Silicon Valley venture capital firms has asked US regulators to take an industry-friendly approach to initial coin offering (ICO) regulations.The Wall Street Journal reports that representatives from Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures met with high-ranking officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 28.The VC firms, which were joined by lawyers from Cooley LLP, Perkins Coie LLP, and McDermott Will & Emery LLP, asked the agencyâ€™s Division of Corporation Finance to give them â€œformal assuranceâ€ù that the SEC would not crack down on ICO tokens in which they have invested.Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures have long been two of Silicon Valleyâ€™s most prolific cryptocurrency investors.Andreessen, whose motto is â€œSoftware is Eating the World,â€ù has invested in numerous ICOs, as well as industry businesses such as Coinbase and OpenBazaar.USV likewise holds numerous stakes in industry companies, including cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital and Filecoin creator Protocol Labs.Notably, both firms contributed to CryptoKittiesâ€™ recent $12 million funding round.Recent public statements from SEC Chairman Jay Clayton have signaled that the SEC believes most ICO tokens are securities, which means that issuers are subject to significant regulatory restrictions when conducting their token sales.Andreessen and USV pushed the agency to classify more ICOs as utility tokens, which do not constitute investments and are not subject to the SECâ€™s purview.â€œFor example, a token that represents a participation interest in a book-of-the-month club may not implicate our securities laws, and may well be an efficient way for the clubâ€™s operators to fund the future acquisition of books and facilitate the distribution of those books to token holders,â€ù Clayton said in a speech of the difference between security and utility tokens.â€œIn contrast, many token offerings appear to have gone beyond this construct and are more analogous to interests in a yet-to-be-built publishing house with the authors, books and distribution networks all to come,â€ù he added.Citing people familiar with the matter, the report claims that the industry is unlikely to receive a broad regulatory exemption, though officials may be open to narrow exemptions that cap contributions and bar participants from reselling tokens at a profit.Featured image from Shutterstock.",1,https://www.ccn.com/silicon-valley-vcs-ask-regulators-to-go-easy-on-the-ico-regulations/
